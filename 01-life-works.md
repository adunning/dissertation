# Alexander Neckam: Teacher, Canon, Abbot

Alexander Neckam [also spelled Nequam, Necham, Neckham, Nekam, Nekham, Nekkam, Necquam: although @hunt:1984schools, pp. 17–18, argued for 'Nequam', more recent scholarship has preferred 'Neckam'] does not fit neatly into the categories typically assigned to authors of the past – it is both too much and too little to say that he was a theologian, philosopher, or poet. The best label that has stuck has been that of 'polymath'. This captures the range of his interests, but it has also set up readers for disappointment who approach Alexander expecting a thirteenth-century Leonardo da Vinci, only to be faced with prose that can sometimes appear slow-moving and immoderate in its embellishment. The author's intentions and historical context show that this is a deliberate feature to give readers the space to grow in health and understanding. Alexander's writings and other surviving documents reveal an Augustinian canon who was indefatigably optimistic, tolerant, and open-minded, seeking to write books meeting both the intellectual and practical needs of his audiences – who responded in kind by preserving and repurposing his work.

There are several famous anecdotes of Alexander's life – his birth at St Albans on the same September night as Richard I in 1157, his mother Hodierna becoming the king's wet nurse and receiving a state pension; the reply he received to his application to the school at St Albans, 'if you are good, you may come; if you are bad (*nequam*), by no means' [@riley:1867gesta, p. 1:196: 'si bonus es, uenias; si nequam, nequaquam', memorialized in a slightly different form, 'si bonus es intres', on an fifteen-century portal from Ascot Park, installed in 2015 at the Weston Library, University of Oxford; an alternate version of the story is found in @rouse:2004henry, pp. 100–101]; the pact he made with a friend to join a religious order, which the other did not keep; his refusal to accept the feast of the Immaculate Conception until he was forced to cancel his lectures for years on end after repeatedly falling ill on the day at his students' prayers [these events are detailed in @hunt:1984schools, chap. 1; for a summary of more recent biographical findings, see @cropp:1991critical, pp. 1–40; @hochgürtel:2008alexandri, pp. ix–xvi]. He held powerful positions as an administrator, likely participating in the Magna Carta as the abbot of Cirencester [abbots are not named in the document of 1215, but that of Cirencester appears in the reissue of 1225: @holt:2015magna, p. 427] and travelling to Rome to attend the Fourth Lateran Council. He died while visiting the bishop of Worcester at Kempsey in 1217, and is thought to be buried at Worcester Cathedral under a time-worn effigy [@floyer:1897mutilated: in correspondence of January 2016, Chris Guy, cathedral archaeologist, notes that the effigy has also been suggested to represent John Fordham, prior of Worcester until his death in 1438, but judges that it is at least contemporary with an adjoining wall built in the early fourteenth century]. He wrote incessantly from an early age, and it is these writings that made him famous. It remains to be seen how Alexander's works integrate with his life and the communities in which he lived.

## Alexander's reception in modern scholarship

The earliest biography and listing of Alexander's works was compiled by the sixteenth-century antiquarian John Leland, who opines, 'Alexander Necham demands a truly honourable place among the writers of his age' [@carley:2010john, pp. 408–409 (chap. 218): 'Alexander Nechamus inter suae aetatis scriptores locum poscit plane honorificum']. Even for Leland, with his tendency to idolize every English author he describes, this is high praise. Given Alexander's fame, it is curious that his most significant works are now almost wholly unknown. This is largely due to the accidents of the history of modern scholarship; a lack of modern editions has left his books largely inaccessible due to a lack of modern editions. One might compare his fate to that of his contemporary and fellow St-Albanite Matthew Paris, the Benedictine historiographer (*c.*1200–59). His work survives in only a handful of copies, and he seems to have written with little more than local usage in mind [cf. @weiler:2009matthew]. Yet after the dissolution of the English monasteries, the most significant Matthew Paris manuscripts came into the hands of Matthew Parker (1504–75), archbishop of Canterbury and bibliophile, who published some of their contents beginning in 1567 [@vaughan:1958matthew, p. 154]. Most of Matthew's writings were subsequently published in the widely distributed Rolls Series [on the history of this  endeavour, see @knowles:1961presidential]. The broad availability of editions of Matthew's works transformed them from almost totally unknown books into some of the most significant literary works of medieval England.

Alexander was much better known than Matthew Paris in his own day, but he has not had such good luck in modern publication. None of his works reached the printing press until the nineteenth-century enthusiasm for folklore resulted in the publication of his *Nouus Esopus* and *Nouus Auianus* (versifications of Aesop and Avianus) in 1854, as part of a collection of other material relating to the history of fables, and they were both published again before the end of the nineteenth century [@duméril:1854poésies, pp. 169–213, 260–267; @froehner:1862magistri; @hervieux:1883fabulistes, pp. 1:702–716, 2:787–812, 3:222–34, 462–467]. Interest in Alexander for his own merits did not surface until Thomas Wright's publication of *De naturis rerum*, a commentary on Ecclesiastes, alongside *Laus sapientie diuine* [@wright:1863alexandri]. Wright was generally interested in the remains of Anglo-Latin literature and conducted much of the pioneering work in the field, though he worked quickly and inevitably made left many gaps [@rigg:1992history, p. xv]. In the case of *De naturis rerum,* he published only the first two of the work's five books as a 'manual of scientific knowledge of the time', arguing that the last three books form 'simply a commentary on the book of Ecclesiasticus [*sic*], which has no direct connexion with that which precedes' [@wright:1863alexandri, p. xiv: also 'Ecclesiasticus' at lxvii]. His choice of manuscripts was fortunate for *De naturis rerum* (basing the text on Oxford, Magdalen College, MS 139, now thought to be from Cirencester itself), though he uses only one for *Laus sapientie diuine* (London, British Library, Royal MS 8 E. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ix</span>), which is late and structures the work incorrectly [@wright:1863alexandri, pp. lxxvi–lxxvii]. This made Alexander accessible to a wider readership for the first time, but also resulted in a skewed view of these works in most scholarship of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The reaction of contemporary reviewers to Wright's edition of *De naturis rerum* is predictable. The *Times* called it 'a bunch of antiquarian sea-weed … a medley of crystal and rubbish' [@lucas:1864works, p. 172]. The *Dublin Review* took issue with Wright's framing of the work, arguing, 'Neckam's object was not science, but devotion; and the facts of natural history are with him but the points of his meditation, or the texts of his sermon.' 'Want of sympathy with the author is a sore drawback in an editor; and Mr. Wright has none with Neckam, none with his peculiar learning, none with his moralities, which to him seem "far-fetched".' [@wiseman:1864alexandri, pp. 495–496; citing @wright:1863alexandri, p. xv] Overall, the book was seen as a worthwhile if unusual addition to the Rolls Series [@1864alexander; @wright:1864alexandri]. Despite its faults, the edition did more than any previous effort to promote the modern study of Alexander's works. It prompted a number of articles observing aspects of Alexander's contribution to the history of science, interesting for their presentation of the material in the context of another discipline, though few offer new findings in terms of Alexander or his writings, and many are misled by Wright in understanding the work's purpose [see for example @f:1896mediaeval; @larson:1913scientific; @weiss:1927alexander; @lippmann:1935vier; @adams:1938medieval; @gaselee:1935natural; @raven:1947english, pp. 4–8, 14–20; @janson:1952apes; @orlowsky:1992narziß, p. 182; @milliman:2012ludus, pp. 74–75]. Because of this publication of *De naturis rerum,* and especially because he was the first European writer to describe the magnetic compass in detail [@bromehead:1944alexander; @may:1955alexander; @smith:1970peter, pp. A12–A14; @smith:1992precursors, pp. 12–18; @guarnieri:2014once], Alexander is now most widely known as an early scientist.

Scholarly attention in the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth was otherwise directed towards Alexander's teaching works: *De utensilibus* [@wright:1857treatise; @scheler:1866trois], *Corrogationes Promethei* [@meyer:1896notice], and *Sacerdos ad altare* [@haskins:1909list; revised in @haskins:1927list; @kantorowicz:1937medieval]. Initial steps were also taken to update and correct the catalogues of his writings made by the early-modern bibliographers, removing spurious attributions by matching identifications with surviving manuscripts [@esposito:1915unpublished; this article gave rise to @maciver:1919scholarship, condemning 'the English' for neglecting to publish more of Alexander's works; @russell:1932alexander brought forward more biographical details]. R.W. Hunt made a leap forward in the knowledge of Alexander's life and works, first with a short but widely cited overview of the writers of the period [@hunt:1936english], and later in his doctoral thesis, *Alexander Neckam* [@hunt:1936alexander]. Unfortunately, though it is said to have become the most commonly consulted thesis in the Bodleian Library, he never published any portion of it. This, somewhat paradoxically, had a chilling effect on scholarship: the existence of the thesis was widely known and its publication expected at any time, preventing most scholars from producing any in-depth research on the subject. The book was finally published posthumously in 1984 as *The Schools and the Cloisters*, having been lightly revised by Margaret Gibson [her approach is summarized through a quotation of Mark 2:21: @hunt:1984schools, p. iv]. Hunt's work defined Alexander for the twentieth century, but the character of academic publishing inhibited the spread of what he had discovered and discouraged others from addressing further questions.

Between 1936 and 1984, Alexander was recognized for his importance in several minor fields of study. His use of Hebrew was noted [@gaselee:1939notes; @loewe:1958alexander; @loewe:1966hebrew]. Some attention was given to Alexander's poetry [@damon:1957note, examining *Corrogationes noui Promethei*; @walther:1962moralasketische; @walther:1965kleineren; @kuijper:1966nonnullis; @berry:1978partial; @pepin:1984autobiography]. The importance of his teaching to grammar [@holmes:1952daily, from *De utensilibus*; @wolff:1974alexandre; @hunt:1979gloses] and the liberal arts in general [@odonnell:1969liberal; @viarre:1969propos] was recognized. Abortive attempts were made to understand Alexander's commentaries on the wisdom books [@wedge:1967alexander; @mahoney:1971critical]. Without dissemination of Hunt's research, it was difficult to contextualize these findings.

The reasons for Hunt's delay to make his findings public are somewhat mysterious. The preface to the published version of the book by Beryl Smalley implies that Hunt was simply a perfectionist, explaining that his work at the Bodleian prevented him from taking the matter of publication seriously [@hunt:1984schools, pp. vii–viii]. Smalley does not mention that Hunt had indeed made plans to publish the book. What the preface describes as 'the author's copy of his thesis' is a lightly edited and annotated copy prepared for a proposal to Oxford University Press. While the version submitted in 1936 was entitled *Alexander Neckam*, this copy has *Alexander Nequam* on the title page, and has slightly different pagination; it is contained in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hunt 102, a box that also includes an annotated copy of Wright's *De naturis rerum.* Hunt 101 and Hunt 103 similarly contain miscellaneous notes from research on Alexander. Loose in the front cover of the typescript is a letter from Smalley herself, dated 13 July 1960 at St Hilda's College, Oxford:<!-- Dear Richard, -->

> Print this just as it is with the strictly necessary additions and revisions! It reads well as it is. I only suggest preparing or adding an account of A.N.'s significance. He strikes me now, fresh from looking at Châtillon's *Libri exceptionum,* as marking the very end of the Victorine tradition with the whole trunk bursting open and scattering its contents over the railway station. Does any scholar of the turn of the century sum up so many divergent trends as A.N.? He's both secular scholar and monk or rather canon. The next generation would produce an encyclopaedia as such, not all mixed up with a commentary. He seems to have been the last of the great non-specialists except for Grosseteste and even he's less all-round because he kept no equivalent of the monastic commentaries.

\noindent Smalley goes on to make a few 'small points' on areas of improvement, proposing only minor modifications to the text. Hers is essentially the scheme that was eventually carried out, but only after more than twenty years had passed. Along with this is a letter from the Clarendon Press, dated 26 July 1960, accepting the book for publication. 'As we agreed last week, I am now returning your typescript, on the understanding that you are going to truncate it somewhere about page 200 and let us have it back as quickly as you can for publication.' The remainder of the note lists the publisher's terms. This requests the removal of the second part of the thesis, which consists of extracts concerning Alexander's life and from his writings; this is the primary difference between the 1936 and 1984 versions. Much of this material is integrated into the footnotes of the final publication, *The Schools and the Cloister*. The result, as reviewers note, is a curious amalgam of the cutting edge of the 1930s and citations of more recent work [the most thorough are @rigg:1986schools; @marenbon:1987schools].

Not that it is at last available for general consumption, Hunt's book has brought about a relative explosion of scholarship on Alexander. This has resulted, most usefully, in editions of several more of his works, making most of his minor writings available [@garbugino:1987alexander; @thomson:1988alexander; @hunt:1991teaching, pp. 1:177–190 addresses *De utensilibus* and provides an edition of London, Wellcome Historical Medical Library, MS 801a (glosses, 2:65–122); @cropp:1991critical; @klein:1998alexander; @bestul:1999meditation; @mcdonough:1999alexander; @mcdonough:2006alexander; @hochgürtel:2008alexandri; @mcdonough:2010alexandri]. The canon of his works continues to be placed on firmer grounds [@mcdonough:2005cambridge; @mcdonough:2008alexander]. There have been studies of his pedagogical works and his approach to language [@haye:1997lateinische; @kneepkens:1997please; @copeland:2010naming; @copeland:2011producing], and these have been applied fruitfully to research on other subjects [@gullick:1996scribe; @vezin:2005reconstitution; @gasparri:2007terminologie; @gardiner:2008buttery; @gumbert:2011tacketed]; to his contributions to theology and logic [@ebbesen:1990philoponus; @oguejiofor:1995arguments, chap. 4; @davenport:1997catholics; @french:1997use; @marrone:2004william, pp. 154–157; @hudry:2011livre, pp. 8–10]; his verse [@gamboajiménez:1986estudio; @mcdonough:2001alexander; @mcdonough:2002two; @bisanti:2005fior; @gärtner:2009fit]; and especially his mythography [@dicke:1987fabeln; @garbugino:1991novus; @klein:1995überlieferungsprobleme; @boatti:1998simbologia; @giovini:1998chiedo; @radif:1998vespertilio; @schulzebusacker:1998romulus; @klein:2000nouus; @bisanti:2002novus; @hodapp:2003fables, pp. 17–21; @manasnúñez:2005fábula; @bisanti:2010novus; @boivin:2011fables; @gärtner:2011auftakt]. Research on Alexander's core work in his biblical commentaries is scarce. The interpretation of *De naturis rerum* continues to be shaped primarily by Wright's edition of the first two books included in this publication: his framing has meant that it has been widely studied within the encyclopedic tradition. Most of this scholarship ignores the work's context within Alexander's other works (unsurprisingly, given their inaccessible state), though its relationship to the *Solatium fidelis anime*, *Laus sapientie diuine*, and *Suppletio defectuum* has been investigated [@záhora:2011tropology]. Nothing of substance has been written on the commentary on Proverbs, though it has been used in assessing Alexander's approach to law [@záhora:2013attendant]. The commentary on the Song of Songs has fared slightly better, with scholarship showing its context within the traditional exegesis of that book [@fulton:1996mimetic; @holdsworth:1996two; @fulton:1998quae; a transcription of 1.6 is provided in @riedlinger:1958makellosigkeit, pp. 320-333], and it is now understood to be the same work as *Laus beatissime uirginis*, which Hunt had thought to have been a lost work by Alexander [@mcdonough:2004laus]. Almost nothing since Hunt has been written concerning the commentaries on either the Athanasian Creed or the Psalter [@dahan:1990marge, pp. 26-27 prints an extract from the gloss on Ps. 13:1]. Great progress has been made in relating Alexander's work to that of his contemporaries, but Hunt's conclusions have neither been verified nor challenged. Most importantly, there has been no attempt to relate Alexander's work to his background as a member of the Augustinian order.

Hunt was also the first to study the manuscripts containing Alexander's works thoroughly, but he did not have the time to provide more than an overview of their character. There is something oddly coherent about them, when they are considered as a group: Wright observed in his edition of *De naturis rerum* that there was a consistent pattern of framed marginal headings in the manuscripts he examined. This suggested to him that the headings were included in an original or very early copy [@wright:1863alexandri, lxxvii], which can now be seen to reflect the practices of Cirencester scribes, arguing for a common origin for the books. Hunt himself guessed that part of Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94 preserves the author's handwriting, a suggestion later amplified by Michael Gullick [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 30–31; @gullick:1990twelfthcentury, pp. 21–23], but a similar hand in other Cirencester manuscripts has been judged to be that of another copyist [@thomson:1988alexander, p. xx]. To date, nobody has attempted to see what this might imply for the composition of Alexander's works.

Scholarship on Alexander Neckam has revealed the biographical details of his life, established what he wrote, and begun to demonstrate his place in European intellectual traditions. Yet our understanding of his role as a historical figure and of his writings remains disjointed. We do not know the contents of all his works in detail, how they relate to other medieval writings, or how his contemporaries used them. Nor do we fully understand Alexander's potential role within the communities in which he lived. As can be seen from this review of scholarship, Hunt's book *The Schools and the Cloister* compartmentalizes Alexander and his writings: first into scholastic and monastic contexts, and secondly within a string of activities, identifying him as a grammarian, versifier and stylist, scientist, preacher, commentator, and theologian [for an example of the influence of Hunt's model, see @mcevoy:2000robert, pp. 8–11]. The question remains: what was the relationship of this multifaceted writer to the historical Alexander Neckam – the teacher, Augustinian canon, and abbot?

## The present study

This dissertation considers Alexander as a canon and abbot in the Augustinian order, using the only artefacts we have from his lifetime – the manuscripts that preserve his writings. The dissertation also takes advantage of new diplomatic evidence published since Hunt's thesis, especially the Cirencester cartulary [@ross:1964cartulary]. I argue that the Augustinians were much more influential in Alexander's thought than has been thought previously, as he most likely became a canon around a decade earlier than previously thought, at Oxford rather than Cirencester, showing the unified progression of his career. The Augustinian mindset illuminates the decisions Alexander made in writing, showing that the slow-paced nature of his commentaries on the wisdom books was a deliberate decision, influenced by the scholastic approach to meditation espoused by the Victorines. The character of the manuscripts containing these works is also explained through Alexander's context at Oxford and Cirencester, showing that he worked collaboratively with his peers to create and distribute his works. After his death, the fate of Alexander's writing was closely tied to that of the community of Cirencester.

The separation of Alexander's works into those addressing distinct scholastic and monastic audiences both arises from and enforces a deduction that he began his cloistered career at St Mary's Abbey in Cirencester. Hunt assumed that the publication of a congratulatory letter of Peter of Blois corresponded directly to the point at which Alexander became an Augustinian and moved to Cirencester. This is not supported by either diplomatic or literary evidence. It is more likely that Alexander joined the Augustinians at St Frideswide's in Oxford after he moved there around 1190. His thought and career is in many ways patterned after that of Robert of Cricklade, who began as a canon at Cirencester and promoted St Frideswide as a figure of learning. This allows for a more realistic chronology for the writing of the works in question, and highlights the middle way between secular and monastic mindsets that the Augustinians pursued.

The influence of the Augustinians is most visible in Alexander's largest body of writings: his commentaries on the biblical wisdom books. These works do not fit neatly into any of the modern categories that scholars have attempted to apply to them. As a result, they are often criticized as slow in progress and extravagant in their prose. Closer analysis suggests this was a deliberate choice intended to give readers space for reflection. Combining his experience as a scholar and preacher, and the reading available to him at Cirencester, Alexander created books that would meet the practical needs of the Augustinians for pastoral care not through the creation of new reference works or systematic enquiries, but through what he calls *meditationes*. These practised the ideas of meditation articulated by figures such as Hugh of St Victor as the next logical step in reading and understanding, which were explored by several other writers associated with the Augustinians in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The books are also deeply personal: a colophon to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* refers to it as 'speculum animi mei' or 'mirror of my soul'. These works are presented as salve for the cloistered, but there is also evidence that they were written with ambitions for influencing the canons' work in wider society. Alexander promoted female figures as models for holy living, marriage as a holy condition, and cooperation between religious orders. He brought scholarship to bear upon the Augustinian order's widely recognized attention to pastoral care, a matter of increasing prominence prior to the Fourth Lateran Council.

Alexander's commentaries were the focus of a campaign to preserve and promulgate his works, together with his sermons. Alexander himself was keenly interested in the publishing process, as can be shown, most notably, through his comments in *De utensilibus* and *Sacerdos ad altare.* In what follows I pursue the evidence for book production in the manuscripts from Cirencester, beginning with the hand in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94 that was identified by Hunt and Gullick as belonging to Alexander; I identify more instances of this script and show that Alexander's work was highly collaborative. This shows not only that Alexander continued to revise his works over an extended period of time, but also that the text of some works as now preserved was probably completed after his death. Master Walter de Melida emerges as the key figure in this effort, who as a canon at Cirencester contributed his skills as a scribe, textual critic, and administrator, and appears to have functioned as a literary executor of sorts for Alexander.

Long after his death, the dissemination of Alexander's writings continued to function as a means of promoting Cirencester's interests and its relationships with neighbouring houses. This is visible in the letters associated with Walter de Melida, and especially apparent in the miscellany of Alexander's works in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42, presented to Geoffrey, abbot of Malmesbury from 1246 to 1260. It is typically referred to as the Alexander Neckam 'florilegium', properly only designating the first part of the manuscript; the volume should instead be taken as a congruent whole, which I have designated *Sol meldunensis* from its incipit. I identify the manuscript as the compilation of Alexander's nephew, Geoffrey Brito, who had personal reasons to preserve his uncle's memory. Charters in the Cirencester cartulary providing his benefices specifically cite the honouring of the former abbot as their motivation. The book served as a means of exchange between the two houses; it continued a literary relationship dating to the time of Robert of Cricklade and William of Malmesbury, and provided a fitting monument to Alexander's unreserved optimism and desire for enlightenment.
