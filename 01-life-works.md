# Alexander Neckam: Teacher, Canon, Abbot

Alexander Neckam (1157–1217) does not fit neatly into the categories typically assigned to authors of the past – it is both too much and too little to say that he was a theologian, philosopher, or poet. The best label that has stuck has been that of polymath. This captures the range of his interests, but it has also set up readers for disappointment who approach Alexander expecting a thirteenth-century Leonardo da Vinci, only to be faced with prose that can sometimes appear slow-moving and immoderate in its embellishment. The author's intentions and historical context show that this is a deliberate feature to give readers the space to grow in health and understanding. Alexander's writings and other surviving documents reveal an Augustinian canon who was indefatigably optimistic, tolerant, and open-minded, seeking to write books meeting both the intellectual and practical needs of his audiences – who responded in kind by preserving and repurposing his work.

There are several famous anecdotes of Alexander's life – his birth at St Albans on the same September night as Richard I, his mother Hodierna becoming the king's wet nurse and receiving a state pension; the pun of *Nequam* on his name (he can occasionally be found in reference works as 'Alexander Bad'); the pact he made with a friend to join a religious order, which the other did not keep; his refusal to accept the feast of the Immaculate Conception until he was forced to cancel his lectures for years on end after repeatedly falling ill on the day at his students' prayers [detailed in @hunt:1984schools, chap. 1; for a summary of more recent biographical findings, see @hochgürtel:2008alexandri, pp. ix–xvi]. He held powerful positions as an administrator, likely participating in the Magna Carta as the abbot of Cirencester [abbots are not named in the document of 1215, but that of Cirencester appears in the reissue of 1225: @holt:2015magna, p. 427] and travelling to Rome to attend the Fourth Lateran Council. He died while visiting the bishop of Worcester at Kempsey in 1217, and is said to be buried at the cathedral under a time-worn effigy [@floyer:1897mutilated]. He wrote incessantly from an early age, and it is these writings that made him famous. Peter of Blois wrote him a congratulatory letter on his joining the Augustinians, praising him for 'your writings and the most celebrated fragrance of your commendable fame' ['Litteratura siquidem uestra, et famae commendabilioris celeberrimus odor': ep. 137, @giles:1847petri, p. 2:22]. It remains to be seen how Alexander's works integrate with his life.

## Alexander's reception in modern scholarship

The earliest biography and listing of Alexander's works was compiled by the sixteenth-century antiquarian John Leland, who opines, 'Alexander Necham demands a truly honourable place among the writers of his age' ['Alexander Nechamus inter suae aetatis scriptores locum poscit plane honorificum': @carley:2010john, pp. 408–409 (chap. 218)]. Even for Leland, with his tendency to idolize every English author he describes, this is high praise. Given Alexander's fame, it is curious that his most significant works are now almost wholly unknown. This is largely due to the accidents of the history of modern scholarship, leaving his books largely inaccessible due to a lack of modern editions. One might compare his fate to that of his contemporary and fellow St-Albanite Matthew Paris, the Benedictine historiographer (*c.* 1200–59). His work survives in only a handful of copies, and he seems to have written with little more than local usage in mind [cf. @weiler:2009matthew]. Yet after the dissolution of the English monasteries, the most significant manuscripts came into the hands of Matthew Parker (1504–75), archbishop of Canterbury and bibliophile, who published some of their contents beginning in 1567 [@vaughan:1958matthew, p. 154]. Most of Matthew's writings were subsequently published in the widely distributed Rolls Series [on the history of this  endeavour, see @knowles:1961presidential]. The broad availability of editions of Matthew's works transformed them from almost totally unknown books into some of the most significant literary works of medieval England.

Alexander was much better known than Matthew Paris in his own day, but he has not had such good luck in modern publication. None of his works reached the printing press until the nineteenth-century enthusiasm for folklore resulted in the publication of his *Nouus Esopus* and *Nouus Auianus* (versifications of Aesop and Avianus) in 1854, as part of a collection of other material relating to the history of fables [@duméril:1854poésies, pp. 169–213, 260–267]. *Nouus Auianus* was published again within eight years, presumably without the editor being aware of the earlier effort [@froehner:1862magistri; the modern editions are @garbugino:1987alexander; @klein:1998alexander]. Interest in Alexander for his own merits did not surface until Thomas Wright's publication of *De naturis rerum*, a commentary on Ecclesiastes [@wright:1863alexandri]. Wright was generally interested in the remains of Anglo-Latin literature, and has been both praised for his interests and cursed for his misconceptions [@rigg:1992history, p. xv]. In the case of *De naturis rerum,* his choice of manuscripts was unfortunate, for which he can be forgiven; but he made a serious error in publishing only the first two of the work's five books as a 'manual of scientific knowledge of the time'. Without even bothering to note correctly the section of the Bible under discussion, he argues that the last three books form 'simply a commentary on the book of Ecclesiasticus, which has no direct connexion with that which precedes' [@wright:1863alexandri, p. xiv: also 'Ecclesiasticus' at lxvii]. This leaves readers with a skewed view of the work, hiding Alexander's true purpose in writing it, namely to reveal the moral dimensions of the natural world.

The reaction of contemporary reviewers to Wright's edition of *De naturis rerum* is predictable. The *Times* called it 'a bunch of antiquarian sea-weed … a medley of crystal and rubbish' [@lucas:1864works, p. 172]. The *Dublin Review* took issue with Wright's framing of the work, arguing, 'Neckam's object was not science, but devotion; and the facts of natural history are with him but the points of his meditation, or the texts of his sermon.' 'Want of sympathy with the author is a sore drawback in an editor; and Mr. Wright has none with Neckam, none with his peculiar learning, none with his moralities, which to him seem "far-fetched".' [@wiseman:1864naturis, pp. 495–496; citing @wright:1863alexandri, p. xv] Overall, the book was seen as a worthwhile if unusual addition to the Rolls Series [@1864alexander; @wright:1864alexandri]. Despite its faults, the edition did more than any previous effort to promote the modern study of Alexander's works. It prompted a number of articles observing aspects of Alexander's contribution to the history of science, interesting for their presentation of the material in the context of another discipline, though few offer new findings in terms of Alexander or his writings, and many are misled by Wright in understanding the work's purpose [see for example @f:1896mediaeval; @larson:1913scientific; @weiss:1927alexander; @lippmann:1935vier; @adams:1938medieval; @gaselee:1935natural; @raven:1947english, pp. 4–8, 14–20; @janson:1952apes; @orlowsky:1992narziß, p. 182; @milliman:2012ludus, pp. 74–75]. Because of this publication of *De naturis rerum,* and especially because he was the first European writer to describe the magnetic compass in detail [@bromehead:1944alexander; @may:1955alexander; @smith:1970peter, pp. A12–A14; @smith:1992precursors, pp. 12–18; @guarnieri:2014once], Alexander is now most widely known as an early scientist.

Scholarly attention in the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth was otherwise directed towards Alexander's teaching works: *De utensilibus* [@wright:1857treatise; @scheler:1866trois], *Corrogationes Promethei* [@meyer:1896notice], and *Sacerdos ad altare* [@haskins:1909list; revised in @haskins:1927list; @kantorowicz:1937medieval]. Initial steps were also taken to update and correct the catalogues of his writings made by the early-modern bibliographers, removing spurious attributions by matching identifications with surviving manuscripts [@esposito:1915unpublished; this article gave rise to @maciver:1919scholarship, which condemns 'the English' with amusing indignation for neglecting to publish more of Alexander's works; @russell:1932alexander brought forward more biographical details]. R.W. Hunt made a leap forward in the knowledge of Alexander's life and works, first with a short but widely cited overview of the writers of the period [@hunt:1936english], and later in his doctoral thesis, *Alexander Neckam* [@hunt:1936alexander]. Unfortunately, though it is said to have become the most commonly consulted thesis in the Bodleian Library, he never published any portion of it. This, somewhat paradoxically, had a chilling effect on scholarship: the existence of the thesis was widely known and its publication expected at any time, preventing most scholars from producing any in-depth research on the subject. The book was finally published posthumously in 1984 as *The Schools and the Cloisters*, having been lightly revised by Margaret Gibson [her approach is summarized in the quotation of Mark 2:21, @hunt:1984schools, p. iv]. Hunt's work defined Alexander for the twentieth century, but the character of academic publishing inhibited the spread of what he had discovered and discouraged others from addressing further questions.

Between 1936 and 1984, Alexander was recognized for his importance in several minor fields of study. His use of Hebrew was noted [@gaselee:1939notes; @loewe:1958alexander; @loewe:1966hebrew]. Some attention was given to Alexander's poetry [@damon:1957note, examining *Corrogationes noui Promethei*; @walther:1962moralasketische; @walther:1965kleineren; @kuijper:1966nonnullis; @berry:1978partial; @pepin:1984autobiography]. The importance of his teaching to grammar [@holmes:1952daily, based on *De utensilibus*; @wolff:1974alexandre; @hunt:1979gloses] and the liberal arts in general [@odonnell:1969liberal; @viarre:1969propos] was recognized. Abortive attempts were made to understand Alexander's commentaries on the wisdom books [@wedge:1967alexander; @mahoney:1971critical]. Without dissemination of Hunt's research, it was difficult to contextualize these findings.

The reasons for Hunt's delay to make his findings public are somewhat mysterious. The preface to the published version of the book by Beryl Smalley implies that Hunt was simply a perfectionist, explaining that his work at the Bodleian prevented him from taking the matter of publication seriously [@hunt:1984schools, pp. vii–viii]. Smalley does not mention that Hunt had indeed made plans to publish the book. What the preface describes as 'the author's copy of his thesis' is a lightly edited and annotated copy prepared for a proposal to Oxford University Press. While the version submitted in 1936 was entitled *Alexander Neckam*, this copy has *Alexander Nequam* on the title page, and has slightly different pagination; it is contained in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hunt 102, a box that also includes an annotated copy of Wright's *De naturis rerum.* Hunt 101 and Hunt 103 similarly contain miscellaneous notes from research on Alexander. Loose in the front cover of the typescript is a letter from Smalley herself, dated 13 July 1960 at St Hilda's College, Oxford:

> Dear Richard,

> Print this just as it is with the strictly necessary additions and revisions! It reads well as it is. I only suggest preparing or adding an account of A.N.'s significance. He strikes me now, fresh from looking at Châtillon's *Libri exceptionum,* as marking the very end of the Victorine tradition with the whole trunk bursting open and scattering its contents over the railway station. Does any scholar of the turn of the century sum up so many divergent trends as A.N.? He's both secular scholar and monk or rather canon. The next generation would produce an encyclopaedia as such, not all mixed up with a commentary. He seems to have been the last of the great non-specialists except for Grosseteste and even he's less all-round because he kept no equivalent of the monastic commentaries.

\noindent Smalley goes on to make a few 'small points' on areas of improvement, proposing only minor modifications to the text. Hers is essentially the scheme that was eventually carried out, but only after more than twenty years had passed. Along with this is a letter from the Clarendon Press, dated 26 July 1960, accepting the book for publication. 'As we agreed last week, I am now returning your typescript, on the understanding that you are going to truncate it somewhere about page 200 and let us have it back as quickly as you can for publication.' The remainder of the note lists the publisher's terms. This requests the removal of the second part of the thesis, which consists of extracts concerning Alexander's life and from his writings; this is the primary difference between the 1936 and 1984 versions. Much of this material is integrated into the footnotes of the final publication, *The Schools and the Cloister*. The result, as reviewers pointed out, is a curious amalgam of the cutting edge of the 1930s and citations of more recent work [@rigg:1986schools being the most thorough; others include @contreni:1985schools; @pfaff:1985schools; @sprandel:1985schools; @waldman:1985schools; @bate:1987schools; @marenbon:1987schools].

Available for general consumption at last, Hunt's book has brought about a relative explosion of scholarship on Alexander. This has resulted, most usefully, in editions of several more of his works, making most of his minor writings available [@garbugino:1987alexander; @thomson:1988alexander; @hunt:1991teaching, pp. 1:177–190 addresses *De utensilibus* and provides an edition of London, Wellcome Historical Medical Library, 801a (glosses, 2:65–122); @cropp:1991critical; @klein:1998alexander; @bestul:1999meditation; @mcdonough:1999alexander; @mcdonough:2006alexander; @hochgürtel:2008alexandri; @mcdonough:2010alexandri]. The canon of his works continues to be placed on firmer grounds [@mcdonough:2005cambridge; @mcdonough:2008alexander]. There have been studies of his pedagogical works and his approach to language [@haye:1997lateinische; @kneepkens:1997please; @copeland:2010naming; @copeland:2011producing], and these have been applied fruitfully to research on other subjects [@gullick:1996scribe; @vezin:2005reconstitution; @gasparri:2007terminologie; @gardiner:2008buttery; @gumbert:2011tacketed]; to his contributions to theology and logic [@ebbesen:1990philoponus; @oguejiofor:1995arguments, chap. 2<!-- check -->; @davenport:1997catholics; @french:1997use; @marrone:2004william, pp. 154–157; @hudry:2011livre, pp. 8–10]; his verse [@gamboajiménez:1986estudio; @mcdonough:2001alexander; @mcdonough:2002two; @bisanti:2005fior; @gärtner:2009fit]; and especially his mythography [@dicke:1987fabeln; @garbugino:1991novus; @klein:1995überlieferungsprobleme; @boatti:1998simbologia; @giovini:1998chiedo; @radif:1998vespertilio; @schulzebusacker:1998romulus; @klein:2000nouus; @bisanti:2002novus; @hodapp:2003fables, pp. 17–21; @manasnúñez:2005fábula; @bisanti:2010novus; @boivin:2011fables; @gärtner:2011auftakt]. Research on Alexander's core work in his biblical commentaries is scarce. The interpretation of *De naturis rerum* continues to be shaped primarily by Wright's edition of the first two books included in this publication: his framing has meant that it has been widely studied within the encyclopedic tradition. Most of this scholarship ignores the work's context within Alexander's other works (unsurprisingly, given their inaccessible state), though its relationship to the *Solatium fidelis anime*, *Laus sapientie diuine*, and *Suppletio defectuum* has been investigated [@záhora:2011tropology]. Nothing of substance has been written on the commentary on Proverbs, though it has been used in assessing Alexander's approach to law [@záhora:2013attendant]. The commentary on the Song of Songs has fared slightly better, with scholarship showing its context within the traditional exegesis of that book [@fulton:1996mimetic; @holdsworth:1996two; @fulton:1998quae; a transcription of 1.6 is provided in @riedlinger:1958makellosigkeit, pp. 320-333], and it is now understood to be the same work as *Laus beatissime uirginis*, which Hunt had thought to have been a lost work by Alexander [@mcdonough:2004laus]. Almost nothing since Hunt has been written concerning the commentaries on either the Athanasian Creed or the Psalter [@dahan:1990marge, pp. 26-27 gives a short edition of the gloss on Ps. 13:1]. Great progress has been made in relating Alexander's work to that of his contemporaries, but Hunt's conclusions have neither been verified nor challenged. Most importantly, there has been no attempt to relate Alexander's work to the Augustinian order.

Hunt was also the first to study the manuscripts containing Alexander's works thoroughly, but he does not discuss them in detail, and made no attempt to interpret the evidence he found. There is something oddly coherent about them: Wright observed in his edition of *De naturis rerum* that there was a pattern of consistent marginal titles in his manuscripts, suggesting that they were part of the original [@wright:1863alexandri, lxxvii], and further comparison with other manuscripts shows that this directly reflects the practices of Cirencester and hence a common origin for the books. Hunt guessed that part of Oxford, Jesus College 94 preserves the author's handwriting, a suggestion later amplified by Michael Gullick [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 30–31; @gullick:1990twelfthcentury, pp. 21–23], but there is also a similar hand in the Cirencester manuscripts that has been judged to be of a different identity [@thomson:1988alexander, p. xx]. To date, nobody has attempted to see what this might imply for the composition of Alexander's works.

Scholarship on Alexander Neckam has revealed the biographical references relevant to his life, established what he wrote, and begun to demonstrate his place in European intellectual traditions. Yet our understanding of his role as a historical figure and of his writings remain disjointed. We do not know the contents of all his works in detail, how they relate to other medieval writings, or how his contemporaries used them. No serious effort has been made to understand Alexander's potential role within the communities in which he lived. As can be seen from this review of scholarship, Hunt's book *The Schools and the Cloisters* compartmentalizes Alexander and his writings: first into scholastic and monastic contexts, and secondly within a string of activities, identifying him as a grammarian, versifier and stylist, scientist, preacher, commentator, and theologian. We have not yet comprehended the relationship of this multifaceted writer to the historical Alexander Neckam – the teacher, Augustinian canon, and abbot.

## The present study

This is a consideration of Alexander as a canon and abbot in the Augustinian order, using the only artefacts we have from his life, namely the manuscripts that preserve his writings. These books can help to show the relationship between Alexander and his peers through providing evidence for the process of creating and distributing his works. It also takes advantage of new diplomatic evidence published since Hunt's thesis, especially the Cirencester cartulary [@ross:1964cartulary]. The fate of his writing was closely tied to that of the institutions in which he served.

The separation of Alexander's works into those addressing distinct scholastic and monastic audiences both arises from and enforces a deduction that he began his cloistered career at St Mary's Abbey in Cirencester. Hunt assumed that the publication of a congratulatory letter of Peter of Blois corresponded directly to the point at which Alexander both became an Augustinian and moved to Cirencester. This is not supported by either diplomatic or literary evidence. It is more likely that Alexander joined the Augustinians at St Frideswide's in Oxford after he moved there around 1190. His thought and career is in many ways patterned after that of Robert of Cricklade, who began as a canon at Cirencester and promoted St Frideswide as a figure of learning. This allows for a more realistic chronology for the writing of the works in question, and highlights the middle way between scholarly and cloistered mindsets that the Augustinians pursued.

The influence of the Augustinians is most visible in Alexander's largest body of writings: his commentaries on the wisdom books. Scholars have had difficulty analysing these works, sometimes abandoning them with disdain after misunderstanding their purpose. These books are often criticized as slow in progress and extravagant in their prose, but this emerges as a deliberate choice intended to give readers space for reflection. Combining his experience as a scholar and preacher, and the reading available to him at Cirencester, Alexander created books that would meet the practical needs of the Augustinians for pastoral care not through the creation of new reference works or systematic enquiries, but what he calls *meditationes*. These practised the ideas of meditation articulated by figures such as Hugh of St Victor as the next logical step in reading and understanding, explored by several other writers associated with the Augustinians in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They are also deeply personal: a colophon to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* refers to it as 'speculum animi mei' or 'mirror of my soul'. While these works seem to have been intended for learned audiences, there is also evidence that they were written with ambitions for improving their effectiveness in broader society. Alexander promoted female figures as models for holy living, marriage as a holy condition, and cooperation between religious orders. The result can be interpreted as the application of scholarship to the Augustinian order's widely recognized attention to pastoral care that was gaining increasing prominence prior to the Fourth Lateran Council.

Alexander's commentaries were the focus of a campaign to preserve and promulgate his works, together with his sermons. Alexander himself was keenly interested in the publishing process, most notably shown through his comments in *De utensilibus* and *Sacerdos ad altare.* By pursuing the evidence for book production in the manuscripts from Cirencester, beginning with the hand in Oxford, Jesus College 94 that was identified by Hunt and Gullick as belonging to Alexander, it is possible both to identify more instances of this script and to show that his work was highly collaborative. This shows not only that Alexander continued to revise his works over an extended period of time, but also that the text of some works as now preserved was probably completed after his death. Master Walter de Melida emerges as the key figure in this effort, who as a canon at Cirencester contributed his skills as a scribe, textual critic, and administrator, and appears to have functioned as a literary executor of sorts for Alexander.

Long after his death, the dissemination of Alexander's writings continued to function as a means of promoting Cirencester's interests and its relationships with neighbouring houses. This is visible in the letters surrounding Walter de Melida, and especially apparent in *Sol meldunensis*, the miscellany of Alexander's works in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42, presented to Geoffrey, abbot of Malmesbury from 1246 to 1260. This is identified as having been compiled by Alexander's nephew, Geoffrey Brito, who had a personal motiviation to preserve the former abbot's memory, as this is specifically cited in the charters providing his benefices. The book served as a means of exchange between the two houses, continuing a literary relationship dating to the time of Robert of Cricklade and William of Malmesbury, and providing a fitting monument to Alexander's unreserved optimism and desire for enlightenment.
