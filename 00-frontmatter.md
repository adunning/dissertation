  Alexander Neckam (Nequam, Neckham, Nekam, Necham, Necquam; also known as Alexander of St Albans; 1157–1217) was a teacher and Augustinian canon, and an important administrator at St Mary's Abbey in Cirencester, participating in royal and papal operations and leading it as abbot from 1213 to 1217. He left an enormous body of writings, typically studied according to genre (as grammatical treatises, biblical commentaries, sermons, and poetry), and as works directed to separate scholastic and monastic audiences. They can be shown to form a more coherent whole by considering Alexander's work within the historical context of his career and membership in the Augustinian order. While it has previously been assumed that Alexander only became an Augustinian canon *c.* 1197 at Cirencester, he more likely joined the order in Oxford, where he moved *c.* 1190 and was associated with St Frideswide's Abbey (now Christ Church). His thought and career is patterned after that of Robert of Cricklade, who began as a canon at Cirencester and promoted St Frideswide as a figure of learning. This influence can be traced in Alexander's largest body of writings: the commentaries on the wisdom books, often thought of as encyclopedias but better understood using Alexander's own label of *meditationes*. These sought to put into practice the ideas of meditation promoted by figures such as Hugh of St Victor. Alexander promoted female figures as models for holy living, and sought closer cooperation between religious orders. Together with his sermons, these commentaries were the focus of a campaign to preserve and promulgate Alexander's works, directed by his *socius* Walter de Melida. This provided a means for the canons of Cirencester to pursue closer relationships with their neighbours. *Sol meldunensis*, the miscellany of Alexander's works in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42 is here identified as having been compiled by Geoffrey Brito, who was the personal beneficiary of preserving the former abbot's memory and presented the work to abbot Geoffrey of Malmesbury (1246–60). The book served as a means of exchange between the two houses, continuing a literary relationship dating to the time of Robert of Cricklade and William of Malmesbury, and providing a fitting monument to Alexander's unreserved optimism and desire for enlightenment.

  This dissertation has benefited from years of ongoing advice from Joseph Goering, who unwittingly triggered the entire enterprise through a 962-word entry in the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* [@goering:2004neckam], as well as that of Alexander Andrée and Alexandra Gillespie. The examination of manuscripts was made possible through a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and I am grateful to the institutions who allowed me access to their books: Cambridge University Library; Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; Pembroke College, Cambridge; Trinity College, Cambridge; the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh; All Souls' College, Oxford; Balliol College, Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; Corpus Christi College, Oxford; Jesus College, Oxford; Magdalen College, Oxford; Merton College, Oxford; New College, Oxford; St John's College, Oxford; the British Library, London; and the Lambeth Palace Library. I owe particular gratitude to the institutions who permitted photography of their manuscripts, enabling much more detailed examination. Above all, this dissertation owes its existence to Susan, a constant source of encouragement and wise counsel.
