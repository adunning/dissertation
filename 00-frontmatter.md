  Alexander Neckam (Nequam, Neckham, Necham, Nekam, Nekham, Nekkam, Necquam; also known as Alexander of St Albans; 1157–1217) was a teacher and Augustinian canon, and an important administrator at St Mary's Abbey in Cirencester, participating in royal and papal operations and leading it as abbot from 1213 to 1217. His extensive writings are typically studied according to genre (as grammatical treatises, biblical commentaries, sermons, and poetry), and as works directed to separate scholastic and monastic audiences. They can be shown to form a more coherent whole by considering Alexander's work within the historical circumstances of his career and the intellectual context of the Augustinian order. While it has been assumed that Alexander only became a regular canon *c.* 1197 at Cirencester, he more likely joined the Augustinians in Oxford, where he moved *c.* 1190 and was associated with the Priory of St Frideswide (now Christ Church). The influence of the Augustinians shaped Alexander's largest body of writings: his commentaries on the biblical wisdom books, often thought of as encyclopedias but better understood using his own label of *meditationes*. These put into practice the idea of meditation as a natural step in the progression of learning, as promoted by figures such as Hugh of St Victor. Alexander viewed this as a means of caring for souls, promoting female figures as universal models of holy living and seeking closer cooperation between religious orders. Together with his sermons, these commentaries were the focus of a campaign to preserve and promulgate Alexander's works, directed by his fellow canon Walter de Melida, whose work can be reconstructed from manuscripts, cartularies, and surviving letters. This provided a means for the members of the abbey to pursue closer relationships with their neighbours. *Sol meldunensis*, the miscellany in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42, is here identified as having been compiled by Geoffrey Brito, who as Alexander's nephew personally benefited from the preservation of the abbot's memory. He presented the work to Geoffrey, abbot of Malmesbury from 1246 to 1260, and the two houses exchanged the book with successive additions, continuing a literary relationship dating to the time of Robert of Cricklade and William of Malmesbury, and providing a fitting monument to Alexander's unreserved optimism and nurturing of sustainable enlightenment.

  This dissertation has benefited from years of ongoing advice from Joseph Goering, who unwittingly triggered the entire enterprise through a 962-word entry in the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* [@goering:2004neckam], as well as that of Alexander Andrée and Alexandra Gillespie. It has also profited from the library of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. The examination of manuscripts was made possible through a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and I am grateful to the institutions who allowed me access to their books: Cambridge University Library; Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; Pembroke College, Cambridge; Trinity College, Cambridge; the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh; All Souls' College, Oxford; Balliol College, Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; Corpus Christi College, Oxford; Jesus College, Oxford; Magdalen College, Oxford; Merton College, Oxford; New College, Oxford; St John's College, Oxford; the British Library, London; and the Lambeth Palace Library. I owe particular gratitude to the institutions who allowed photography of their manuscripts, enabling much more detailed examination. Above all, this dissertation owes its existence to Susan, a constant source of encouragement and wise counsel.
