title: Reading Alexander through the florilegium 'Sol meldunensis'
...

Some of the best evidence for how contemporaries might have used Alexander's writing is found in a manuscript now held at Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42. This is a florilegium, called here 'Sol meldunensis' by its incipit; it cleverly repurposes passages from nearly all Alexander's works (including some that do not otherwise survive) to form new 'sermons', as it presents them, adding connecting phrases to blend the excerpts together, though the resulting works are so long that they can hardly have been used as such.

# From Geoffrey to Geoffrey

*Sol meldunensis* is addressed to 'Gaufridus' (fol. 71v), abbot of the abbey of Malmesbury (20 km from Cirencester), which allows the book to be dated to 1246–60 [@knowles:2001heads, p. ?]; presumably Geoffrey would have known Alexander before his death in 1217. The author identifies himself as 'Galfridus' (fol. 3r): he is not otherwise known [he is listed in @sharpe:1997handlist, p. ?]: 

(fol. 3r)

> | Sol meldunensis et cinthia lux monachorum,
> | Suscipiat tua queso nouum dignatio carmen
> | Quod tibi Galfridi deuotio simplicis offert.
> | Te correctorem sicio pastor pie: limam
> | Apponas operi, qui corrigis aspera claustri.
> | Sis pius indultor culpe, iudexque benignus
> | Absoluas, quod deliquit presumptio lingue.

> | O sun and moon of Malmesbury, light of the monks,
> | May your honour accept, I ask, a new song
> | Which the devotion of simple Geoffrey offers to you.
> | I thirst for your correction, pious pastor:
> | May you put a polish on this work, who corrects the roughness of the cloister.
> | May you be a pious favourer of fault, and may you, a benignant judge,
> | Absolve what the presumption of the tongue does wrong.

<!--Check what Nigel Morgan, Gothic MSS 2:130 has to say. -->

The word 'simplicis' in the third verse is glossed 'claustralis', which could leave him either as a monk at Malmesbury or regular canon at Cirencester. Perhaps he could be identified with a 'magister Galfridus de Stanrewik' mentioned as owing rent to the abbey at Cirencester in 1240 [@ross:1964cartulary, no. 614]. 

<!--So why would a canon at Cirencester be writing to the abbot of Malmesbury? What was happening around here at the time? (Something to do with debts incurred at C, or was that later?) -->

# The Manuscript

The manuscript has been judged to have been produced at Cirencester, on the basis that no other library in the thirteenth century seems to have had the collection of Alexander's works that was used for the creation of the book [@hunt:1984schools, p. ?]. It certainly appears to have belonged to Cirencester; at the top of fol. 3r, one can make out the erased work 'Cyrencestris' (with the help of an ultraviolet light), and on fol. 2v, one finds this:

> | To Cirencester & bid them pray for me.
> | He that prayeth for me Jesu have merci on hym.

> | Iste liber constat moritio
> | gyffardi testante iesu

<!--who was Maurice Gyffard? -->

The manuscript, is also, however, somehow associated with the nearby abbey of Malmesbury, and has occasionally been thought to have been produced there [@binski:2011western, p. 106]. The Cirencester marks are of a somewhat later date, and there is plenty of room for the manuscript to have been produced at Cirencester, sent to Malmesbury, and later brought back to Cirencester, perhaps if there was a more sustained interest in Alexander's writings there after the death of abbot Geoffrey. <!-- Check through Malmesbury books: anything that might have come from Cirencester? -->

    - seems to be a standard Cambridge binding; identical to Kk.5.10
        - that book also has parchment strips between quires; seems to
          be a Cambridge thing also, but note that it must have been
          done before James, since it sometimes confuses him
    - collation: a2, 1(10+1, 3add), 210–610, 7(8+1, 8add), 810, 9(10+1,
      11add), 1010–2110 || 2210 || 2310, 24(8–4, 5–8canc)
        - the inserted slip at 71 is foliated 70bis
        - 92 (which is labelled as 93 because someone thought that it
          was misbound after "92" = 93) seems to be a later addition:
          the catchword at the bottom of 91v matches 93r, but 92 is
          probably just a later addition; it is completely standalone.
          It could theoretically be placed after 93, but I see no
          reason to do so, and structurally it is very definitely bound
          up with the preceding quire (the stub from the other end of
          the leaf is found before 82)
        - a different collation is pencilled into the back of the book;
          it is incorrect

R.W. Hunt thought that this was a quire from another manuscript; this may be so, but it seems far too convenient that it is presented first of all as another Geoffrey addressing an Alexander, surely recalling the abbot of Malmesbury and Alexander Neckam. Geoffrey of Monmouth and [Alexander of Lincoln] were both bishops; Geoffrey of Malmesbury and Alexander Neckam were both abbots. Perhaps this 

The inclusion of the passage is otherwise mysterious: William of Malmesbury, was not particularly fond of Geoffrey of Monmouth [@malmesbury:1998gesta, p. ?], but perhaps this was seen as a convenient way of reflecting a desire on the abbot's part to

@mcdonough:2005cambridge judges that the book was probably a near copy to the original; I would go so far as to say that it *is* the original. There are several long passages added to the text after the fact, done in a way that indicates addition rather than correction. Perhaps most tellingly, at one point the scribe is copying out the following passage from Neckam's commentary on Proverbs:

> Melius est sedere in angulo domatis quam in domo communi cum uxore litigiosa. Set hec deo annuente exponetur … (fol. 173r)

If we look at the copy of the commentary in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94, the next word should have been 'inferius', but this is omitted. The compiler seems to have been happily reading along, and suddenly realized that this will not be 'explained below' in this book, because he is planning to end the excerpt at the end of the next sentence. He skips over 'inferius' partially erases 'set hec deo annuente exponetur' (and further underlines it in red to indicate that it is to be ignored), and the scribe moves on.

I have not yet been able to conclude decisively whether or not this work is a direct autograph of Galfridus. While almost the entire book is in the same hand, there is two passages added in other hands (fols. 13v and 166r), the latter of which can be seen to be contemporary with the manuscript by the fact that it is integrated into its decorative scheme.  Perhaps one of these is an addition in the hand of the compiler, with the rest is dictated by him. In yet another hand is a glossed copy of a work written by another Galfridus, presented as a letter of Geoffrey of Malmesbury to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, which is somewhat less professionally executed and added onto the manuscript. (Having another Geoffrey and Alexander together probably seemed too good a coincidence to omit.) Clearly, in any case, Galfridus was not working alone: it is sometimes easier to determine authorial involvement than to pinpoint the author's precise role.
