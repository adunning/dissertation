title: Reading Alexander through the florilegium 'Sol meldunensis'
abstract: |
    Galfridus, the compiler of *Sol meldunensis*, the prose Alexander Neckam florilegium in Cambridge, University Library, MS Gg.6.42, is shown to made a fairly narrow body of selections from Alexander Neckam's works in his effort to make the material more useful for contemporary purposes of consultation. The layers of addition discernible in the manuscript are suggested to have been the result of a collaboration between the houses of Cirencester and Malmesbury.

After Alexander's death, readers continued to repurpose his writings to meet their developing needs. Some of the best evidence for how contemporaries might have used Alexander's writing is found in a florilegium now held at the Cambridge University Library [the manuscript has previously been discussed by @esposito:1915some; @russell:1932alexander; @hunt:1936alexander, pp. 160-161; @mcdonough:2004laus; @mcdonough:2005cambridge]. The main section of the book, called here *Sol meldunensis* from its incipit, compiled by one Galfridus, strings together passages from nearly all Alexander's prose works (including some that do not otherwise survive) to form new 'sermons', as it presents them, adding connecting phrases to blend the excerpts together, though the resulting works are so long that they can hardly have been used as such. Various prose and verse pieces have been added to the manuscript by both the original and other hands, likely a product of an exchange between the houses of Cirencester and Malmesbury.

## Physical Description

### Structure

The book is collated a^2^, 1^10+1^ (3 added), 2^10^–6^10^, 7^8+1^ (8 added), 8^10^, 9^10+1^ (11 added), 10^10^–21^10^ || 22^10^ || 23^10^, 24^10–6^ (6–10 cancelled), for a total of ii + 236 parchment folios (foliated 1–237, with an inserted slip in quire 8 foliated 70bis). The irregular number of folios in quire 8 suggests that it could originally have been planned as the end of the manuscript; *Sol meldunensis* book one (which, unlike book two, is not labelled as such) ends on fol. 69v.

An earlier cataloguer, probably M.R. James, has pencilled an alternative collation on the back flyleaf: '2 flyleaves. 1^12^ (10 cancelled) 2–6^10^ 7^10^ (2 cancelled) 8–9^10^ 10^12^ (11 cancelled) 11–21^10^ | 22^10^ | 23^10^ 24^10^ (wants 5–10): 237 ff (out of 242; 238–42 lost; 70 *bis* an inserted slip; 92 misbound after 93)'. This incorrect perception appears to have two causes. Each quire is surrounded by a thin strip of parchment, which can be easily confused with a cancelled folio. (This appears to be a Cambridge binding practice, also found e.g. on MS Kk.5.10.) The note on fols. 92 and 93 was intended as a solution to the problem that the catchphrase on fol. 91v does not match the first line of 92r. The cataloguer was probably reacting to @hardwick:1856catalogue [p. 3:232], who had stated that a leaf was missing between fols. 91 and 92, and recognized it as a later standalone addition. A mark appears to direct the insertion of the leaf's text on 93v, but it does not seem necessary to postulate that the leaf should have been originally placed there; it is bound with quire 9, not 10 as he thought (the stub from the other end of the leaf is found before 82). The cataloguer modified the pencilled folation for fols. 92 and 93, swapping them to reflect this theory (leaving the real fol. 92 labelled 93 and fol. 93 labelled 92).

## Contents

The manuscript can be divided into three 'booklets' bound into a single volume [on booklet theory, see @gillespie:2011medieval]: the first consisting of *Sol meldunensis*, Galfridus's prose florilegium composed entirely of Alexander Neckam's works, divided into two books (which is often what scholars mean when they refer to the 'Neckam Florilegium'); the second of Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Prophetia Merlini*; the third of a verse florilegium containing mostly Alexander's poetry but also related material from other authors, lacking formal organization but certainly not put together at random. The question is whether this material was intended to be placed together; *Sol meldunensis* has a definite close, and the later booklets do not refer to it directly. The second booklet has even been thought to come from a different manuscript entirely [Hunt??? cat??? McD???], though in its decoration it is in many ways imitative of the material that preceds it. The third booklet was certainly produced by the same scribes as *Sol meldunensis*. Under closer examination, the materials form an imitative unity.

### I. *Sol meldunensis*, the prose Alexander Neckam florilegium (quires 1–21, fols. 3–212)

Though Galfridus does not appear in any lists of English writers, he presents his florilegium as a new work, and it seems most appropriate to think of it as such as rather than a mere mine for information on the canon of Alexander Neckam's writings. It is structured under the following major headings:

- Epistula. (fol. 3r)
- Incipit proemium in librum Secundum. (fol. 70r)
- Incipit liber secundus. In quo agitur de misericordia et de suggillatione quorundam uitiorum. (fol. 72r)

There is a good case to be made for believing that the second book is a later addition: book one  is never described as such, closing  with a selection of poetry  and another verse epistle. Book two  similarly closes with a selection of verses addressed to Geoffrey. The entire work is written in the same hand, and so it is not entirely clear why the author determined to make this change in organization.

### II. Geoffrey of Monmouth, *Prophetia Merlini* (quire 22, fols. 213–222)

R.W. Hunt thought that this was a quire from another manuscript [????]; this may be so, but it seems far too convenient that it is presented first of all as another Geoffrey addressing an Alexander, recalling the abbot of Malmesbury and Alexander Neckam; this rubric is in the same hand as that  Geoffrey of Monmouth and [Alexander of Lincoln] were both bishops; Geoffrey of Malmesbury and Alexander Neckam were both abbots. The inclusion of the passage is otherwise mysterious: William of Malmesbury was not particularly fond of Geoffrey of Monmouth [@malmesbury:1998gesta, p. ?]. The text is widely spaced to allow for glosses to be inserted between the lines. Alisha reader has taken advantage of this though not perhaps to the extent envisioned by the original scribe.

The manuscript is given the siglum ζ in Michael Reeve's edition of the text, one of five manuscripts viewed as stemming from the hypothetical ancestor Π [@monmouth:2007history, pp. xxx, l].

### III. The verse Alexander Neckam florilegium (quires 23–24, fols. 223–237)

The final section of the manuscript is a collection of verses written both by Alexander Neckam and his contemporaries. Broadly speaking, the first section is a collection of verses on wine; the second, a collection of material on fables; the last, devotional material. Unlike, however, the prose florilegium, the scribe does not even make an attempt at an outward system of organizatiHe and SAEon. In common with the first part of the manuscript is the page layout, the marginal titles, and the script. There is no verse epistle or proem. The final item in the manuscript, *De saluatore mundi*, is not even attributed to Alexander Neckam, though from the style is is hard to imagine that it could have been written by anybody else.

### Poems on Wine

- Petrus Blesensis, De commendatione vini (223)
- Robertus de Bellafago, De commendatione cervisiae (223–223v)
- Petrus Blesensis, Responsio (223v–224)
- Alexander Nequam, De vino (224v–232)

Peter of Blois knew Alexander [; cited by @russell:1932alexander, p. 263]

### Other verses by Alexander Neckam

- Novus Avianus (232v–234v)

- De vase aureo in quo continetur Eucharistia, etc. (235–236)

- De passione Salvatoris (237–237v).

## Origin

*Sol meldunensis* is addressed to 'Gaufridus' (fol. 71v), 'pastor pie' (fol. 3r). The only known candidate fitting this description is Geoffrey, abbot of Malmesbury abbey (20 km from Cirencester), which allows the volume to be dated to 1246–60 [@knowles:2001heads, p. 2:51; @hunt:1984schools, p. 118]. Presumably Geoffrey would have known Alexander before his death in 1217. The author identifies himself as 'Galfridus' (fol. 3r):

> | Sol meldunensis et cinthia lux monachorum,
> | Suscipiat tua queso nouum dignatio carmen
> | Quod tibi Galfridi deuotio simplicis offert.
> | Te correctorem sicio pastor pie: limam
> | Apponas operi, qui corrigis aspera claustri.
> | Sis pius indultor culpe, iudexque benignus
> | Absoluas, quod deliquit presumptio lingue. (fol. 3r)

> | O sun and moon of Malmesbury, light of the monks,
> | May your honour accept, I ask, a new song
> | Which the devotion of simple Geoffrey offers to you.
> | I thirst for your correction, pious pastor:
> | May you put a polish on this work, who corrects the roughness of the cloister.
> | May you be a pious favourer of fault, and may you, a benignant judge,
> | Absolve what the presumption of the tongue does wrong.

<!--Check what Nigel Morgan, Gothic MSS 2:130 has to say. -->

The word 'simplicis' in the third verse is glossed 'claustralis',^['Simplex uocatur claustralis; dicitur et simplex qui sine plica duplicitatis est.'] implying that he was a monk or regular canon [one wonders whether he could be connected to a 'magister Galfridus de Stanrewik' mentioned as owing rent to the house in 1240: @ross:1964cartulary, no. 614]. A recent catalogue suggests that the book could have originated at either Cirencester or Malmesbury [@binski:2011western, p. 106]; Cirencester seems most likely, as this is the only known location where all the works the text uses were available [@mcdonough:2005cambridge, p. 792n41]. It certainly belonged to Cirencester in a later period; at the top of fol. 3r, one can make out, with the help of an ultraviolet light, the erased word 'Cyrencestris' (below this is an inscription in a humanist hand beginning 'De', also expunged). The form matches a later style of *ex libris* found in a manuscript of Alexander's commentary on the Psalms (now Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 284) dating to the late thirteenth or fourteenth century.

## Intent

71v, Epistle at the end of the proem to book two:

The first eight lines of the verse epistle at the end of the proem to book two (fol. 71v) is taken from the dedication of Reginald of Canterbury's *Vita Malachi*, lines 2–8, originally addressed to Lambert, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St Bertin; wisely omitting the lines describing the book's crossing of the sea, Galfridus's last four lines from Reginald's lines 28–31 [edited in @liebermann:1888raginald, pp. 531–532]:

> | Pagina dulce putat cum te mea sponte^[sepe *Reginald*] salutat
> | O Gavfride^[Lamberte *Reginald*] pie pater, omnis papa sophie.
> | Sit precor eius aue tibi gratum dulce suaue.
> | Esse quidem gratum tibi wlt o uir probitatum
> | Quod te magnificat de te bona singula dicat;
> | Grates esse, putes tibi nostras ergo salutes.
> | Nunc bone Gavfride^[Lamberte *Reginald*] laus cuius ubique sonatur,
> | Tucior ut per te sit littera nostra precatur.
> | Hic^[Qui *Reginald*] si forte tibi liber inconcinna loquatur
> | Iudex parce sibi ne statim proiciatur.
> | Sepe relegisse cartam iuuat et meminisse;
> | Sepius adde manum: quod habebis^[hebebit *Reginald*] erit puto planum.

> | My page thinks sweetly when it greets you voluntarily,
> | O Geoffrey, pious father, father of all wisdom.
> | May, I pray, its hail be pleasing to you, sweet, pleasant.
> | It wishes indeed to be pleasing to you, O man of honesty,
> | That it magnifies you, concerning you it speaks many good things;<!--check DMLBS -->
> | May you rejoice, may you then think on our salvation.
> | Now, good Geoffrey, whose praise resounds everywhere,
> | It asks that through you our letters may be safe.
> | If perchance this book should speak clumsily to you,
> | Judge it sparingly, that it may not be immediately abandoned.
> | Often it is helpful to have reread a book and remember it;
> | More often, add a hand: what you will have will be, I think, plain.

(Cf. the various notes made in the margins.)


The final verse epistle of *Sol meldunensis* further supports the idea that Galfridus was based at Cirencester and not Malmesbury, indicating a desire to correspond [noted in (Hunt??? and) @mcdonough:2005cambridge, p. 792]. As with the epistle closing the first half of the work, this is primarily adapted from Reginald of Canterbury, here addressing Gilbert Crispin, abbot of Westminster from 1085 to 1117 [printed in @wright:1872anglo, pp. 2:259–60]. The first group of lines (according to the manuscript's own divisions) correspond to Reginald's lines 23–28 and 37–38; the last to his 39–40. The middle couplet is from the end of a poem by Alexander Neckam addressed to 'doctor Radulfe' [@neckam:2008suppletio, p. 227 (carmina metrica, 16.17–18); also cited in @méril:1854poésies, pp. 170–171].<!--check H for note on Radulfus --> It appears on fol. 212v as follows:

> | ¶ Nunc pater et domne tu uideris hic liber omne
> |     Seu punctum tulerit^[Cf. Horace, *De arte poetica* 343–44: 'omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci, / lectorem delectando pariterque monendo.'] seu uiciosus erit.
> | Stare uelis, stabit; si non, hunc flamma cremabit;
> |     Laus sua sermo tuus interitusue suus.
> | Si posui partes uelud is qui ne⟨s⟩ciit artes,
> |     Hac miserere uice doctor apostolice.
> | Laude tui plena dedit hec rudimenta camena,
> |     Ob decus ingenue laudis ubique tue.
>
> | ¶ Mutua discurrat inter nos pagina; nota
> |     Mens tua mensque mea sit mediante nota.
>
> | ¶ Gaudia presentis uite semperque manentis
> |     Et bona cuncta deus det tibi domne meus.

> | ¶ Now, O father and lord, you see
> |     whether this book carries every point or is full of faults.
> | If you wish it to remain, it will remain; if not, a blaze will burn it;
> |     your speech is its praise or destruction.
> | If I have arranged its parts as somebody who does not know the arts,
> |     have mercy on this fate, O apostolic doctor.
> | Filled with you praise, this poetry gives the rudiments
> |     before the glory of your natural praise everywhere.
>
> | ¶ Let a page go between us in turn;
> |     may your mind be noted as well as mine.
>
> | ¶ May God give you the joy of the present and continuing life,
> |     and all good things, my lord.


*Nota* here could refer both to the adjective (i.e. 'known') as well as the noun (a mark or sign).



Reginald of Canterbury, Domno Gilleberto abbati Westmonasteriensi (ed. Wright, Anglo-Latin Satirical Poets and Epigrammatists, vol. 2, 260) 39–40


It is tempting to think that this explains the book's structure.

Quire 22, containing Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Prophetia Merlini*, is in a another hand from the rest of the tome, and indeed @hunt:1984schools [p. ???] thought that it was from a different manuscript entirely. It seems plausible that this was an addition directed by the abbot in response to the invitation: the text is presented as opening with a letter to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln. If Geoffrey the monk first sent a text by an Alexander to Geoffrey the abbot, it is clever to respond with a text by a Geoffrey, addressed to an Alexander, back to Geoffrey. Quires 23 and 24 might then be further additions from Cirencester, to which the abbot might have responded with the various additions to the prose florilegium on fols. ???; indeed, there is potential here for several more stages of back-and-forth. Perhaps the book happened to be in Cirencester awaiting further additions at the abbot's death, and was never returned to Malmesbury, lacking any monks there with an interest in Alexander's works.

the addition of another text from a Geo

- and note that this is *not* from Reginald (discuss this poem), so this is valid (though the third verse McDonough quotes is not the same sentence!)

<!--So why would a canon at Cirencester be writing to the abbot of Malmesbury? What was happening around here at the time? (Something to do with debts incurred at C, or was that later?) -->

While this is something of a conjecture, what one can almost certainly say is that the *Sol meldunensis* manuscript is not a copy. Hunt guessed that the manuscript was 'one of the original fair copies' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 118]; more detailed analysis shows that the volume is the original, probably the only copy every made. There are several long passages added to the text after the fact, done in a way that indicates addition rather than correction (fols. **???**). Perhaps most tellingly, at one point the scribe is copying out the following passage from Neckam's commentary on Proverbs:

> Melius est sedere in angulo domatis quam in domo communi cum uxore litigiosa. Set hec deo annuente exponetur … (fol. 173v)

If we look at the copy of the commentary in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94, the next word should have been 'inferius', but this is omitted. The compiler seems to have been happily reading along, and suddenly realized that this will not be 'explained below' in this book, because he is planning to end the excerpt at the end of the next sentence. He skips over 'inferius' partially erases 'set hec deo annuente exponetur' (and further underlines it in red to indicate that it is to be ignored), and the scribe moves on.

I have not yet been able to conclude decisively whether or not this work is a direct autograph of Galfridus. While almost the entire book is in the same hand, there is two passages added in other hands (fols. 13v and 166r), the latter of which can be seen to be contemporary with the manuscript by the fact that it is integrated into its decorative scheme.  Perhaps one of these is an addition in the hand of the compiler, with the rest is dictated by him. In yet another hand is a glossed copy of a work written by another Galfridus, presented as a letter of Geoffrey of Malmesbury to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, which is somewhat less professionally executed and added onto the manuscript. (Having another Geoffrey and Alexander together probably seemed too good a coincidence to omit.)

## Structure

## Sources

## Method of Quotation

As one works through the manuscripts, a number of trends become apparent:

- The beginning each source is carefully noted (though occasional errors are made, usually through the omission of rubrics).
- Sources are not exactly quoted verbatim, but words are added to make them flow together with the other excerpts and ensure that no loose ends are left after their removal from their original context (e.g. removing cross-references).
- Each passage is not necessarily a new selection; a single long passage is often selected and interspersed with other works. Although Galfridus uses selections from across the Alexandrine corpus, the selections from within those works tend to be concentrated to certain parts of the book, rather than being spread evenly, perhaps indicating that he did not actually have to 

How was this book intended to be read? One assumes that it is part of the rise of consultation that rose around this time [@hermand:2014lecture], and that it was probably not intended to be read from beginning to end.

On fol. 2v, one finds this in a fifteenth-century hand:

> | To Cirencester & bid them pray for me.
> | He that prayeth for me Jesu have merci on hym.

> | Iste liber constat moritio

<!--who was Maurice Gyffard? -->

The manuscript was among the books owned by John Moore, bishop of Ely (1646–1714), presented to the library in 1715 by George I, with the standard bookplate on the opening flyleaf [@ringrose:1998royal].
