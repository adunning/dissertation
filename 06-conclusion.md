# Alexander's Future

## Thesis summary

This study has investigated the influence of the Augustinian order in Alexander Neckam's writing, both in its creation and circulation. We have seen that Alexander most joined the Augustinians at St Frideswide's in Oxford, making it a much earlier influence in his life than has previously been thought. As a result, his entire corpus needs to be seen as a unity rather than two almost separate groups addresses to scholastic and monastic audience, with a clean break occurring when Alexander moved to Cirencester. He was deeply influenced by Augustinian authors such as Hugh of St Victor and Robert of Cricklade. His time at Oxford appears to have nourished his particular commitment to expounding the relevance of female figures as role models. Most of all, his Augustinian mindset prompted him to develop biblical commentaries in the form of *meditationes*, applying the knowledge he acquired in the schools in a form suitable to the new pastoral care movement.

These commentaries form the centrepiece of Alexander's work at Cirencester, reflected both by the effort put into them and in their afterlife. Surviving copies show Alexander's revisions to allow easier reference and comprehension. He appears to have been working on his commentary on Proverbs as well as his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum* at his death. There is a remarkable consistency between the various copies, suggesting that they were the product of a co-ordinated publication campaign. This might have been linked to the work of Alexander's *socius* Walter de Melida, who is known to have been particularly interested in collecting and spreading his sermons. Letters involving Walter and documentary evidence shows that this literary activity gave the abbey the opportunity to pursue relationships with other religious communities – and not only Augustinians, reflecting Alexander's own priorities. Evidence for this collaboration is vividly preserved in *Sol meldunensis* (Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42). Originally produced by Alexander's nephew Geoffrey Brito, this is a miscellany of Alexander's works, addressed to Geoffrey the abbot of Malmesbury from 1246 to 1260. This book appears to have circulated between the two houses at least once, with both communities making additions and revisions to the text.

## Future work

This has only begun to set the stage for more accurate and inspiring work on Alexander. There are still many remaining questions concerning the work of the Augustinians at Oxford; the character of Cirencester and its tradition of manuscript production; and the relationship between these and other houses. To advance our knowledge of Alexander himself and to make his work accessible to a modern audience, there is a pressing need for editions and translations of his works that take into account our knowledge of the manuscript tradition.

### Oxford and the Augustinians

Work on the history of educational institutions in Paris has benefited enormously from greater understanding of the school of Saint Victor, which has helped to define the extent of the abbey's influence both on learning and on the reception of its writers, especially Hugh of St Victor. No such movement has yet taken place in the history of Oxford, where the assumption the nineteenth-century historians that the Augustinians essentially had no influence on the university (and that the sway they held as landlords was probably negative) continues to hold sway. Whatever might have happened in later times, the influence of Robert of Cricklade, the probability that Alexander was both a lecturer there and a member of St Frideswide's, and the safe assumption that he wrote more than three of his works there shows that this needs to be reconsidered in the context of the late twelfth century.

### Understanding Cirencester

There is no evidence for book production at Cirencester after *Sol meldunensis*: the only later writings associated with the abbey are the additions to its cartulary, and a manuscript of Alexander's gloss on the Psalms, now Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodley 284. The latter book can only be shown to have been owned by the abbey, and was not necessarily produced there, as suggested by the fact that it reproduces the unrevised version of Alexander's text. The almost complete lack of evidence for bookmaking after the time of Geoffrey Brito might be due to the ravages of the dissolution, but it is also possible that this tradition came to an end after its corrupt prior William de Haswell bankrupted the abbey in the 1270s [@rollison:2011commune, p. 24; @evans:1993cirencester, p. 126; @willisbund:1898episcopal, pp. 86–87 <!-- check -->]. The forty-five known manuscripts surviving from Cirencester nonetheless form a remarkable collection, including volumes at Jesus College, Oxford and Hereford Cathedral preserved with their original bindings. These manuscripts also contain several works that have received no scholarly attention, notably those by Robert of Cricklade (some in autograph). Studying these manuscripts, the texts they contain, and their scribal additions would further illuminate the reading interests of the Augustinians, their process of book production, and the relationships between Cirencester and its neighbours.

### Editing Alexander

If Alexander Neckam is to have any future either in scholarship or among general readers, it is critical to edit and translate his works. Editions have been slow to appear, many editions have been promised that were not delivered. This seems likely to remain the case until editing ceases to be viewed by the scholarly community as an ancillary activity, and we provide the means to publish premodern source materials in more accessible formats. This stance restricts scholars' ability to make either new or more solidly grounded judgements: the unavailability of Alexander's writings meant that this study both took much longer to produce and has been circumscribed in its conclusions.

This paralysis in the study of medieval history can be escaped through abandoning the ideal of the critical edition in favour of electronic publications of diplomatic or documentary texts. As part of this study, working editions have been produced of the *Meditatio de Magdalena* or *Tractatus super admirabili conuersione beatissime Magdalenes*, from Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2; *Questiones secundum magistrum Alexandrum de Sancto Albano*, from London, Lambeth Palace Library, 421; *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, from Oxford, Jesus College, 94; *Tractatus super Parabolas Salomonis*, also from Oxford, Jesus College, 94; *Sol meldunensis*, Geoffrey Brito's miscellany in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42; and the anthology of Alexander Neckam's verse in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, Latin 11867. The eventual aim is to provide at least one diplomatic edition of each of Alexander's works, which will allow their text to be searched, enable the application of stylometry and other statistical analysis, and most of all make it possible to read them together with ease for the first time.

To ensure that these editions are available for reuse and correction by others, the files have been made available under an open licence (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike) using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines, a thoroughly documented, straightforward format. Early versions have been integrated with the [Corpus Corporum](http://mlat.uzh.ch/) database operated by the University of Zurich. Unfortunately, there are no publishers of technology-independent critical editions as of this writing, making a broader application of this model difficult.

Part of the aim of this work on Alexander Neckam is to provide a more sustainable model for producing a first edition of a premodern work that is only available in manuscript form. While modern researchers sometimes bemoan the greater productivity of scholars of past centuries, it is often not recognized that we have been working to a different standard. When many medieval works were printed for the first time in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they were only based on one or two manuscripts – and these continue to be the editions we use today, even for works by prominent authors such as Peter Lombard and Peter Comestor, because it is impossible to replace them with full critical editions in a climate that devalues editing and promotes short-term funding. Documentary editions can thrive in this context, and by making them immediately available in an electronic form, the impropriety of printing a provisional text is avoided. Over time, these documentary editions can gradually be built up into more accurate forms that take more manuscript evidence into account.

*Sol meldunensis* is a particularly apt example for the applicability of this model. As it has been shown that the scribe is careful and had accurate sources available, working from Cirencester, it also follows that it can be helpful in cases of textual difficulty. Yet the miscellany is itself a standalone work: as Geoffrey melds together excerpts from Alexander's books as new 'sermons', adding phrases and modifying the text as he goes, many of the variants found in this book were purposely introduced, but it is difficult to judge what these are without the original text. It would make little sense to show all variants from this manuscript in the form of a critical apparatus, nor would this provide enough context to allow the reader to make a judgement. Any full critical edition of a text by Alexander Neckam is therefore dependent on *Sol meldunensis*, but this text requires its own edition, which cannot be considered complete without editions of all the works by Alexander to which it refes. This is a typical example of how a printed book with a critical apparatus fails scholars: it simply cannot contain the information necessary for the reader to check the work of the editor. Alexander's works, then, cannot be properly edited without understanding this manuscript; but neither can *Sol meldunensis* be published with a full apparatus without editions of Alexander's works. What is needed is a method of provisionally publishing a documentary edition of each manuscript, gradually linking these with new editions and updating them as the contents of the manuscripts are revealed.

In assembling a collection of Alexander's works, many more examples have emerged demonstrating the value of editing a manuscript on its own terms, as well as the historical context that can be shown through comparing separate texts. An earlier edition of *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, which covered the first book of the work only [@mahoney:1971critical], argues that there is no relationship between the two main manuscripts (Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 528: given the sigla J and B). This may appear to be the case if one only collates the texts in their corrected form against one another. Carefully working through the scribal emendations made to J showed that B (or its ancestor) was likely copied directly from J, but before it was corrected.

In approaching scribes with more charity, and assuming that they essentially knew what they were doing, many more details emerge that contribute to a much richer text. An edition of Alexander's meditation on Mary Magdalene [@bestul:1999meditation] acknowledges the presence of certain marginal rubrics, but omits them: studying these reveals that they are of a similar character to headings found elsewhere in Alexander's writings, sometimes in his own hand, suggesting that they are integral to the text. Further, paraph marks are provided in the manuscript, and reading the text with these reveals a sensible organization that highlights its relationship to the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*: but the edition imposes its own paragraph structure without informing the reader of this. Similarly, the sole manuscript of the *Corrogationes Noui Promethei* includes highly sensible paragraph divisions, but the edition ignores these, again without even notifying the reader of their presence [@cropp:1991critical]. These are more obvious details: many minor details have also gone wrong in editions of medieval Latin. It was once common practice to classicize all Latin texts regardless of their period, and some of these spellings remain entrenched. It is widely assumed, for instance, that *Cristus*, on the rare occasions when it is written in an unabbreviated form, is an error for *Christus*; but by keeping track of abbreviations, it is possible to show that this was precisely how most scribes in southern England at the turn of the thirteenth century would have rendered it. By recording the original punctuation, capitalization, and spelling of a manuscript, one can learn a great deal about the scribe's approach, and even save oneself time.

Creating a transcription of a manuscript on its own terms forces one to account for the scribe's understanding of the work, helping to avoid common syntactical errors. Most editors of medieval Latin texts learn textual criticism through classical works, where the punctuation is never original and often misleading; because of this, many editors (including myself, in my first run at *Ex diuersis auditis*) ignore the punctuation in a manuscript, and insert modern marks as they work. Inevitably, however, the manuscript influences one's transcription, which often results in a period or a comma appearing wherever any kind of punctuation appears in the witness. This is often precisely wrong. Medieval Latin texts were written with a predecessor to our system of punctuation, but with significant differences. There are many variations on its application, meaning that it is often necessary to read a section of the text in the original form to understand how scribes use their marks, the utility of which @parkes:1992pause sought to convince scholars. In thirteenth-century manuscripts, the proper transposition of a *punctus elevatus* into our modern system is usually not a comma, but *nothing at all*. Having realized this simple fact, I was able to find many places where I had oversimplified or even mangled a sentence. It is surprisingly common to find errors in published editions from this period that can be traced to an inappropriate and usually undocumented imitation of the original punctuation. Given that, in medieval Latin manuscripts, it sometimes represents the writer's own wishes – in Alexander Neckam's books, a hand that emends the punctuation extensively probably belongs to the author – it is only sensible to pay close attention to its function, and in some cases even to present it within the edition rather than impose a modern system. Readers of medieval Latin are already accustomed to reading differing English, French, German, and Italian customs of punctuation, along with the *per cola et commata* method found in editions of the Vulgate, and there is no reason to think that they could not also deal with the original, especially if a vernacular translation is supplied in parallel with the edition. Moreover, in a digital publication, it is possible to provide both a diplomatic transcription of the original and a format designed for less specialized readers.

## Alexander the Augustinian

Alexander Neckam challenges the typical stereotypes of the Middle Ages. At the same time as being a lecturer in Oxford, he also appears to have been an Augustinian; his move to Cirencester was not an escape from the scholastic to the monastic world, but simply a way to continue his work, and perhaps gain access to a superior publication organ. In place of the harsh, critical words that readers often expect from medieval preachers, we find instead almost nothing but kindness and optimism. Rather than a cleric who knew nothing but book learning, we find someone equally at home in a vestry, forest, court, or kitchen. Far from skirting creativity or viewing the *auctores* as fully sufficient, Alexander sought to make them newly accessible to his students, and to enable them to do new things with them. Instead of loathing women, he unceasingly puts them forward as examples worthy of contemplation and imitation. If this study has succeeded to any degree, it has begun to show that the unity of his life, works, and community is still worth consideration in the modern world. Let us find out more about his works, and enable a new generation to read them.
