# Alexander's Future

## Community and writing

This study has investigated the influence of the Augustinian order in Alexander Neckam's writing, both in its creation and circulation. We have seen that Alexander most likely joined the Augustinians at St Frideswide's in Oxford, and that the Augustinan order was a much earlier influence in his life than has previously been thought. As a result, Alexander's entire literary output needs to be seen as a unity rather than two almost separate groups addressed to scholastic and monastic audiences, marked by a clean break occurring when Alexander moved to Cirencester. His time at Oxford appears to have nourished his particular commitment to expounding the relevance of female figures as role models, reflecting the approach to Frideswide taken by Robert of Cricklade. Most of all, the influence of Augustinian writers such as Hugh of St Victor prompted him to develop biblical commentaries in the form of *meditationes*, applying the knowledge he acquired in the schools in a form suitable to the pastoral care movement.

Alexander's biblical commentaries form the centrepiece of his work at Cirencester, reflected both by the effort put into them and in their afterlife. Surviving copies show Alexander's revisions to allow easier reference and comprehension. He appears to have been working on his commentary on Proverbs as well as his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum* at his death. There is a remarkable consistency between the various copies, suggesting that they were the product of a co-ordinated publication campaign. Direct evidence for this is found in the work of Walter de Melida, who is known to have been particularly interested in collecting and spreading Alexander's sermons. Letters involving Walter and documentary evidence shows that this literary activity gave the abbey the opportunity to pursue relationships with other religious communities – and not only Augustinians – which reflected Alexander's own priorities. Evidence for this collaboration is vividly preserved in *Sol meldunensis* (Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42). Originally produced by Alexander's nephew Geoffrey Brito, this is a miscellany of Alexander's works, addressed to Geoffrey the abbot of Malmesbury from 1246 to 1260. The book appears to have circulated between the two houses at least once, with both communities making additions and revisions to the text.

## Future work

The study presented here is meant to set the stage for greater understanding of the influence of communities in the intellectual life of medieval Europe. There are still many questions concerning the work of the Augustinians at Oxford; the character of Cirencester and its tradition of manuscript production; and the relationship between these and other houses. To advance our knowledge of Alexander himself and to make his work accessible to a modern audience, there is a pressing need for editions and translations of his works that take into account our knowledge of the manuscript tradition. In all of Alexander's writings, there is a great deal that is not yet understood, and allowing him to speak to modern readers will challenge our stereotypes of premodern approaches to learning, women, marriage, and community.

<!-- The idea of purposely unhurried reading has surfaced again in recent times under banners such as the 'Slow Movement', with several studies suggesting positive psychological benefits [see e.g. @nell:1988psychology]. This question has gained new urgency in the context of reading through electronic devices. Medieval writings are often far more applicable in today's society when understood in their proper historical context than when modern expectations are projected on them. -->

### Oxford and the Augustinians

Work on the history of educational institutions in Paris has benefited enormously from greater understanding of the school of Saint-Victor, which has helped to define the extent of that abbey’s influence both on learning and on the reception of its writers, especially Hugh of St Victor. No such study has yet been undertaken for the history of Oxford, where the assumption of nineteenth-century historians that the Augustinians had little or no influence on the university still holds sway. Whatever might have happened in later times, the influence of Robert of Cricklade, the probability that Alexander was both a lecturer there and a member of St Frideswide's, and the safe assumption that he wrote more than three of his works there shows that the role of the Augustinians in late twelfth-century Oxford needs reconsideration.

### Understanding Cirencester

There is no evidence for book production at Cirencester after *Sol meldunensis*: the only later writings associated with the abbey are the additions to its cartulary. The almost complete lack of evidence for bookmaking after the time of Geoffrey Brito might be due to the ravages of the dissolution, though book production was on decline by the thirteenth century in many cloistered communities [@thomson:2008monastic, pp. 165–167]. This may have been exacerbated in Cirencester's case after its corrupt prior William de Haswell squandered the abbey's resources in the 1270s [@willisbund:1898episcopal, pp. 86–87 (no. 1275); @rollison:2011commune, p. 24; @evans:1993cirencester, p. 126]. By the time of the dissolution, the house appears to have recovered, with a much higher income than many other houses [for a comparative table, see @knowles:1971medieval, pp. 139, 154]. The forty-five known manuscripts surviving from Cirencester nonetheless form a remarkable collection, including volumes at Jesus College, Oxford and Hereford Cathedral preserved with their original bindings. These manuscripts also contain several works that have received no scholarly attention, notably those by Robert of Cricklade (some in autograph). Studying these manuscripts, the texts they contain, and their scribal additions would further illuminate the reading interests of the Augustinians, their processes of book production, and the relationships between Cirencester and its neighbours. Most of all, as the cases of Walter de Melida and Geoffrey Brito show, there are many stories waiting to be told from combining palaeographic, literary, and diplomatic evidence.

### Editing Alexander

If Alexander Neckam is to have a future more reflective of the importance of his life and thoughts, either in scholarship or among general readers, it is critical that we edit and translate his works. Editions have been slow to appear, and many have been promised that were not delivered. This seems likely to remain the case until editing ceases to be viewed by the scholarly community as an ancillary activity, and until we provide the means to publish premodern source materials in more accessible formats. Without new editions, scholars impeded from making either new or more solidly grounded judgements.

The study of medieval history will advance faster if we abandon the printed critical editon as an ideal in favour of technology-independent publications of diplomatic or documentary texts, published in electronic and eventually printed formats as appropriate. As part of this study, I created electronic editions of the *Meditatio de Magdalena* or *Tractatus super admirabili conuersione beatissime Magdalenes*, from Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS O.i.2; *Questiones secundum magistrum Alexandrum de Sancto Albano*, from London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS 421; *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, from Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94; *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis*, from the same manuscript; and *Sol meldunensis*, Geoffrey Brito's miscellany in Cambridge, University Library, MS Gg.6.42. My aim is eventually to provide at least one diplomatic edition of each of Alexander's works, which will allow their text to be searched, enable the application of stylometry and other statistical analysis, and most of all make it possible to read them together with ease for the first time.

Part of the aim of this work on Alexander Neckam is to provide a more sustainable model for producing a first edition of a premodern work that is only available in manuscript form. While modern researchers sometimes bemoan the greater productivity of scholars of past centuries, it is rarely recognized that we have been working to a different standard. When many medieval works were printed for the first time in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they were only based on one or two manuscripts – and these continue to be the editions we use today, even for works by prominent authors such as Peter Lombard and Peter Comestor, because it is impossible to replace them with full critical editions in a climate that devalues editing and promotes short-term funding. Documentary editions, however, can be produced in this context; by making them immediately available in an electronic form, we circumvent the impropriety of printing a provisional text. Over time, these documentary editions can gradually be built up into more accurate texts that take more manuscript evidence into account. Unfortunately, there are no publishers of technology-independent editions of premodern texts as of this writing, which means that application of this model remains difficult.

*Sol meldunensis* is a particularly apt example for the applicability of this model. As it has been shown that the scribe – working from Cirencester – was careful and had accurate sources available, it also follows that the manuscript can be helpful in cases of textual difficulty. Yet the miscellany is itself a standalone work: as Geoffrey melds together excerpts from Alexander's books as new 'sermons', adding phrases and modifying the text as he goes, many of the variants found in this book were purposely introduced, but it is difficult to judge what these are without comparison to original text. It would make little sense to show all variants from this manuscript in the form of a critical apparatus, nor would this provide enough context to allow readers to make judgements about the texts it contains. Any full critical edition of a text by Alexander Neckam is therefore dependent on *Sol meldunensis*, but the text requires its own edition, and it cannot be considered complete without editions of all the works by Alexander to which it refers. This is a typical example of how a printed book with a critical apparatus fails scholars: it simply cannot contain the information necessary for the reader to check the work of the editor. The transmission of Alexander's works cannot be fully understood without this manuscript; but *Sol meldunensis* cannot be published in a lasting form without editions of Alexander's works. What is needed is a method of provisionally editing a documentary edition of each manuscript, gradually linking these with new texts and updating them as the contents of the manuscripts are revealed.

<!-- In assembling a collection of Alexander's works, many more examples have emerged that demonstrate the value of editing a manuscript on its own terms, as well as the historical context that can be shown through comparing separate texts. An earlier edition of *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, which covered the first book of the work only [@mahoney:1971critical], argues that there is no relationship between the two main manuscripts (Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 528: given the sigla J and B). This may appear to be the case if one only collates the texts in their corrected form against one another. Carefully working through the scribal emendations made to J showed that B (or its ancestor) was likely copied directly from J, but before it was corrected. When we approach scribes with more charity, and assume that they knew what they were doing within the constraints of their time and circumstances, details emerge that contribute to a much richer understanding of the texts we edit and read. An edition of Alexander's meditation on Mary Magdalene [@bestul:1999meditation] acknowledges the presence of certain marginal rubrics, but omits them: studying these reveals that they are of a similar character to headings found elsewhere in Alexander's writings, sometimes in his own hand, which suggests that they are integral to the text. Further, paraph marks are provided in the manuscript, and reading the text with these reveals a sensible organization that highlights its relationship to the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*: but the edition imposes its own paragraph structure without informing the reader of this. Similarly, the sole manuscript of the *Corrogationes Noui Promethei* includes highly sensible paragraph divisions, but the edition ignores these, again without even notifying the reader of their presence [@cropp:1991critical]. These are more obvious details: many minor details have also gone wrong in editions of medieval Latin. It was once common practice to classicize all Latin texts regardless of their period, and some of these spellings remain entrenched. It is widely assumed, for instance, that *Cristus*, on the rare occasions when it is written in an unabbreviated form, is an error for *Christus*; but by keeping track of abbreviations, it is possible to show that this was precisely how most scribes in southern England at the turn of the thirteenth century would have rendered it. -->

Creating a transcription of a manuscript on its own terms is a way to account for a scribe's understanding of the work, and to help avoid common syntactical errors. The original punctuation, capitalization, and spelling of a manuscript reveal a great deal about a scribe's approach, and can even save an editor time. Most editors of medieval Latin texts learn textual criticism through classical works, where the punctuation is never original and often misleading; because of this, many editors ignore the punctuation in a manuscript, and insert modern marks as they work. Inevitably, however, the manuscript influences the transcription, which often results in a period or a comma appearing wherever any kind of punctuation appears in the witness. This is often conveys the impression that the scribe had no understanding of the text, when more fault lies with the modern transcriber. Medieval Latin texts were written with a predecessor to our system of punctuation, but with significant differences. There are many variations on its application, meaning that it is often necessary to read a section of the text in the original form to understand how scribes use their marks, the utility of which @parkes:1992pause sought to convince scholars. In thirteenth-century manuscripts, the proper transposition of a *punctus elevatus* into our modern system is often not a comma – but nothing at all. Having realized this simple fact, I was able to find many places where I had oversimplified or even mangled a sentence in my own editions. It is surprisingly common to find errors in published editions from this period that can be traced to an inappropriate and usually undocumented imitation of the original punctuation. Given that, in medieval Latin manuscripts, punctuation sometimes represents the writer's own wishes – in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94, a hand that emends the punctuation extensively probably belongs to the author – it is only sensible to pay close attention to its function, and in some cases even to present it within the edition rather than impose a modern system. Readers of medieval Latin are already accustomed to reading differing English, French, German, and Italian customs of punctuation, along with the *per cola et commata* method found in editions of the Vulgate, and there is no reason to think that they could not also deal with the original, especially if a vernacular translation is supplied in parallel with the edition. Moreover, in a digital publication, it is possible to provide both a diplomatic transcription of the original and a format designed for less specialized readers.

## Alexander the Augustinian

Alexander Neckam shows that there is much still to be learned about the relationship between medieval writers and the communities in which they lived, as well as the consequences of their context to the reception of their works. At the same time as being a lecturer in Oxford, Alexander also appears to have been an Augustinian; his move to Cirencester was not an escape from the scholastic to the monastic world, but simply a way to continue his work, and perhaps gain access to superior resources for publication. Once we understand the rationale for his style as supporting growth in both intellect and health, he shines forth as relevant to present-day concerns, and positively likeable. Rather than a cleric who knew nothing but book learning, we find someone equally at home in the vestry, wilderness, court, or kitchen. Far from skirting creativity or viewing the *auctores* as fully sufficient, Alexander sought to make them newly accessible to his students, and to enable them to do new things with them. Instead of loathing women, he unceasingly puts them forward as examples worthy of contemplation and imitation. If this study has succeeded to any degree, it has begun to show that the connections between his life, works, and community are still worth consideration in the modern world. Let us find out more about Alexander's works, and enable a new generation to read them.
