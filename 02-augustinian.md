# The Augustinian Canons in Alexander's Career and Writings

One of the most difficult problems of the history of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is understanding the relationship between educational institutions and cloistered communities. It was commonplace until recently to assume that one could make a clean division between the two. This view is encouraged in some ways by medieval writers themselves, as in Serlo of Wilton's poem, 'Linquo coax ranis', condemning the conceit of scholastic philosophers [@öberg:1965serlon, no. 78]. It has never been disputed that religious orders in the twelfth century were keenly interested in recruiting from the schools, as vividly shown in the preaching of Bernard of Clairvaux [@ferruolo:1985origins, p. 47]. But even where religious communities existed in close proximity to schools in the twelfth century, it was often assumed that they wanted nothing to do with one another. These assumptions have governed the twentieth-century scholarship on Alexander Neckam, and shaped the interpretation of what he wrote.

More recent scholarship is increasingly showing that monastics were keenly interested both in reading the latest work from the schools and in contributing to it. The Augustinian or Austin regular canons in particular, who called themselves 'cloistered' but were not monks in a strict sense [@dickinson:1950origins, pp. 198–201], formed a middle way between complete rejection of the world and full life within it. A re-examination of Alexander's career shows that one cannot separate his scholastic and cloistered work. It is usually thought that, following a teaching career at Dunstable, the Benedictine school at St Albans, and Oxford, Alexander experienced a conversion experience of sorts, joining the Augustinian canons and moving to Cirencester around 1197 and embarking on writings of a much more ambitious character. There is no hard evidence for this. The available documentation makes better sense if it is instead assumed that Alexander first joined the Augustinian canons at St Frideswide's Abbey in Oxford when he moved there around 1190. This would suggest that more of his writing took place before he moved to Cirencester, and provide a less precise but more realistic chronology for his works. The Augustinian order emerges not as something of an afterthought in Alexander's life, but the unifying factor of his career and writings.

## Dating Alexander's writings by genre

While Hunt attributed the majority of Alexander's works to his time at Cirencester [@hunt:1984schools, chap. 2], this is largely founded on the dichotomy he established between Alexander's 'scholastic' and 'monastic' writings, with the assumption that the latter could only have been produced at Cirencester. The result places the publication of only six of his works before Alexander's move to Cirencester, where he is first certainly documented in 1203, and at least fourteen (including his most complex and lengthy writings) to the final period of his life, when he would also have been most occupied with administrative duties. The evidence more likely suggests that he first became a canon at St Frideswide's in Oxford.

### Hunt's chronology of Alexander's work

There are only a handful of absolute chronological indicators in Alexander's writings; one must use these in combination with cross references between his works to determine the period in which they were written. R.W. Hunt was the first critic to assess all of Alexander Neckam's works, and in his book *The Schools and the Cloister* he struck upon what seems to modern readers an obvious distinction between the works: many of his works are clearly designed for teaching purposes, whereas others exhibit a highly discursive style that is typically associated with monastic writers. He presents the following 'approximate chronological groups' for dating Alexander's works [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 125-126]:

i. Early Writings, *c.*1177–*c.*1190

    *c.*1177+
    : *De utensilibus*
    : Commentary on Martianus Capella
    : *Nouus Auianus*
    : *Nouus Esopus*

ii. Oxford Period, *c.*1190–*c.*1197

    *c.*1190+
    : Commentary on the Athanasian Creed
    : Questiones
    : Sermons

iii. Canon of Cirencester, *c.*1197–1213

    *c.*1197+
    : *Laus beatissime uirginis*
    : *Solatium fidelis anime*
    : *Corrogationes Promethei*
    : *Corrogationes Promethei* versified
    : Gloss on the Psalter

    pre-1205
    : *De naturis rerum et in Ecclesiasten*

    1199–1210
    : *Sacerdos ad altare*

    pre-1213
    : Commentary on Proverbs
    : Commentary on the Song of Songs
    : *Speculum speculationum*

    *c.*1213
    : *Laus sapientie diuine*

iv. Abbot of Cirencester, 1213–1217

    1213+
    : *Corrogationes noui Promethei*
    : *Super mulierem fortem*

    1216–17
    : *Suppletio defectuum*

v. Undated: *De commendatione uini*, hymns, minor verses, *Meditatio de Magdalena*, *Exhortatio ad religiosos*

vi. Undated and lost: *De nuptiis Mercurii*, *Epistola ad discipulum*, *Passio sancti Albani*

\noindent This arrangement neatly sums up Hunt's argument concerning Alexander: that he began as a student in Paris, and spent much of his career (from *c.*1177 to *c.*1197) as a teacher, presumably a secular cleric, at Dunstable, St Alban's, and Oxford. After a complete change in mindset from 'scholastic' to 'monastic', he was finally able to retire to Cirencester to focus on writing for around sixteen years of his life, until his career as an author was largely consumed by administrative duties for the last four years of his life as an abbot. The scheme is tidy apart from a few obvious errors – *Exhortatio ad religiosos* is not a work by Alexander Neckam, but Serlo of Wilton [printed in @öberg:1965serlon, pp. 159–162] – but unrealistic once one considers the sheer bulk of the material being assigned to Cirencester. It presents a writer who had supposedly only produced a handful of short works in the prime of his youth but nonetheless became famous for these, and then suddenly flourished, though he had never previously written a fully original long-form work.

The date of Alexander's conversion is much less secure than Hunt presents it, and it is just as likely that he became an Augustinian canon at Oxford rather than Cirencester. Hunt's date of 1197 for both Alexander's conversion and his move to Cirencester hinges on a letter of Peter of Blois congratulating Alexander on having taken up vows, but it cannot be dated as precisely as he believed. All other evidence suggests that Alexander was already an experienced canon by around 1200; the abbey cartulary shows that he was given responsibility in the affairs of the abbey long before becoming its abbot. Moreover, a span that might be as short as ten years is far too little time to produce works of such length and originality as Alexander's commentaries on Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs, as well as *Speculum speculationum*; nor could Alexander have completed the vast amount of research that *Corrogationes Promethei* would have required in that time. He must therefore have started drafting these books well in advance – and if his later work can indeed be distinguished by its monastic character, as Hunt argues, he must have become a canon well before 1197.

### The chronology of Alexander's works as an Augustinian

The key problem with Hunt's argument for the chronology of Alexander's works hence his involvement in the Augustinian order is the assumption that the work of the schools and the cloisters could not mix. He believes that if Alexander was referring to himself as having joined an abbey, as he does in his gloss on the Psalter this must also mean that he had stopped teaching [@hunt:1984schools, p. 27]. In every other respect, this gloss is a direct product of the schools, and the chronology becomes more plausible if one allows that Alexander's 'scholastic' works might have been composed while he was a canon, and that he could have begun to write his 'monastic' works while he was still teaching.

Beyond the interpretation of Alexander’s biography, several objective corrections can be made to Hunt's list based on additional cross references of which he was unaware. None of Alexander's works up to his gloss on the Psalter is securely datable; Hunt presents them as earlier writings due to their lack of cross references to his other books, and their occasionally derivative character. Hunt took attributions to 'master Alexander of St Albans' as a sign of an early date, though this needs to be treated with the usual caution, especially since it appears in some copies of *De naturis rerum*, demonstrably finished at Cirencester.^[See below, [Appendix A: Alexander's Works].] Omitting Alexander's sermons and minor verses, which were presumably written throughout his life, the approximate dates for his writings can be revised as follows, providing only the dates of their completion:

i. Teacher at Dunstable and St Albans, *c.*1183–*c.*1190 [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 3–4 presents the evidence for Alexander having arrived at Dunstable in 1183, based on Matthew Paris, and suggests that he was probably at Paris from *c.*1175–82]

    *c.*1183+
    : *De utensilibus* [@hunt:1991teaching, p. 1:178 prints the standard *accessus* to the work, which specifies this title, also used in several manuscripts; the form *De nominibus utensilium* seems to have been popularized only because it appears in the manuscript used for the first edition, @wright:1857treatise, p. 1:96]
    : *Nouus Esopus*
    : *Nouus Auianus* [appears to include some borrowings from *Nouus Esopus*: @klein:1998alexander, p. 105]

ii. Teacher at Oxford and canon of St Frideswide's, *c.*1190–*c.*1200

    *c.*1190+
    : *Super Martianum*^[This work is closest in style to Alexander's commentaries on the Athanasian Creed and the Psalter, but may have been written at an earlier date.]
    : *Expositio simboli Athanasii episcopi* [manuscripts refer to the author as either 'Magister Alexander Nequam' or 'Magister Alexander de sancto Albano': @hunt:1984schools, pp. 129–130]
    : *Questiones*^[The sole manuscript, Lambeth, Palace Library, 421, fol. 124va, refers to the author as 'Alexandrum de sancto Albano'.]

    1193+
    : *Glose super psalterium* [reference to his abbacy in Oxford, Jesus College, 94 a later addition, and earliest manuscripts are attributed to 'Magister Alexander Nequam'; refers to the Third Crusade: @hunt:1984schools, pp. 26-27]

iii. Canon of Cirencester, *c.*1200–1213

    pre-1205
    : *Corrogationes Promethei* [refers to teaching in the past tense: @hunt:1984schools, pp. 24–25; might fall anywhere in the chronology before *De naturis rerum*, but gives the impression of being closer to his time of his own education, with occasional references to his own master: @hunt:1984schools, p. 6n30]
    : *Corrogationes Promethei metrice*
    : *Solatium fidelis anime* [refers to teaching in the past tense, with an apparent reference to *Super psalterium*, at fol. 26va: cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 25]
    : *Laus beatissime uirginis* (commentary on the Song of Songs) [refers to work at Oxford in the past tense: @mcdonough:2004laus shows that these are the same works; reference to *Solatium fidelis anime*, @hunt:1984schools, p. 25]
    : *De naturis rerum* (commentary on Ecclesiastes) [@hunt:1984schools, p. 26 notes a story at 1.27 written before the fall of Rouen on 24 June 1204; but @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 99–100 suggests that the book might nonetheless have been completed at a later date; 1.2 refers to *Laus beatissime uirginis*, *Solatium fidelis anime*, and *Corrogationes Promethei*, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 16]
    : *De commendatione uini* [the structure of *Sol meldunensis* as well as a letter from Peter of Blois, @revell:1993later, no. 31, suggests that *De commendatione uini* was dedicated to Thomas Carbonel, abbot of Gloucester from 1179 until 1205: discussed in more detail below, '[Poems on wine (fols 223r–232r)]']

    pre-1213
    : *Meditatio de Magdalena*^[There is no specific evidence that either this or *Super mulierem fortem* were written after *De naturis rerum*.]
    : *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*^[Refers to the *Meditatio de Magdalena* (Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 79ra) and *Laus beatissime uirginis* (fol. 99vb).]
    : *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis* (incomplete)^[Title refers to Alexander as abbot, but this is likely a later addition. Datable to after 1199, with a reference to the death of Richard I: Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 58ra. It seems likely that Alexander was still working on both this and *Speculum speculationum* at his death.]
    : *Speculum speculationum* (incomplete) [title refers to Alexander as a canon: refers to *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* at 1.2.10, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 23; and *Super parabolas*, 3.81.1, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 344; @thomson:1988alexander, p. ix gives 1201 as a *terminus post quem*, based on a quotation of a decretal of Innocent III]

iv. Abbot of Cirencester, 1213–17

    1213+
    : *Corrogationes noui Promethei* [written from the perspective of an abbot: cf. @cropp:1991critical, pp. 43–52]
    : *Laus sapientie diuine* [refers to the death of William de Montibus in 1213: @hunt:1984schools, p. 27; @rigg:1992history, p. 116 gives date of 1213–15; one manuscript refers to Alexander as a canon, but the text seems to have been finished after his journey to Rome: @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 19–22]
    : *Sacerdos ad altare* [refers to *Laus sapientie diuine*: @mcdonough:2010alexandri, p. ix]

    1216–17
    : *Suppletio defectuum* [refers to the death of King John in October 1216: @mcdonough:1999alexander, p. xi]

\noindent Genre continues to play a role in the reconstruction of this chronology, and where precise dates cannot be provided, works of a similar character have been grouped for convenience. (For example, there is no reason to believe that the prose and metrical versions of *Corrogationes Promethei* were written at the same time.) This is most evident in the distinction between Alexander's work at Oxford and his earlier writings. *De utensilibus*, *Nouus Esopus*, and *Nouus Auianus* are all designed to teach Latin and poetic style; *Super Martianum*, *Expositio simboli*, and *Super psalterium* appear to support lectures, while *Questiones* is typical of scholastic question-literature. The year of Alexander's move to Cirencester is still unknown: 1200 is a rounded date, based on his earliest mention in the cartulary. It is intended to leave open the possibility that the works written before 1205 might have been drafted at St Frideswide's. *Laus* is likely based on his lectures on the Song of Songs [*Laus beatissime uirginis* 6.24, cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 8n39]. One might guess that it would have taken around a decade to complete *Laus beatissime uirginis*, the two versions of *Corrogationes Promethei*, *De naturis rerum*, and *De commendatione uini*.

Even Alexander's *Commentum super Martianum* cannot be entirely ruled out as a product of Alexander's time as an Augustinian, since in his commentary on the Song of Songs he refers to the canons' interest in the work [@mcdonough:2006alexander, p. xvi]. The Augustinian order allowed Alexander to apply his scholastic training directly to present knowledge in new ways.

## Alexander's role in Oxford

Although the most straightforward reading of Alexander's work suggests that he was an Augustinian at Oxford, Hunt assumed that he did not become a canon until moving to Cirencester [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 9–12]. This reflects the historiography of the early twentieth century: most of the research on medieval Oxford from the early twentieth century discouraged any notion that religious communities had any interest in being involved in its schools. Herbert Salter conducted particularly extensive research on the Augustinians in Oxford [@salter:1936medieval; @salter:1929cartulary; @salter:1929medieval; @salter:1922chapters; @salter:1919geoffrey], and came to the conclusion that their influence was limited to that of landlords; if anything, he argued, they had a negative effect on the university. The evidence for his view comes mainly from fourteenth- and fifteenth-century sources: there is comparatively little documentation for the Augustinians in the twelfth century, and more recent research has suggested that the canons took a much more active role [@postles:1985learning; @postles:1987patronus; @postles:1993austin; @barron:2002augustinian].

Alexander describes his teaching at Oxford as 'reading publicly in theology' [*Laus beatissime uirginis* 1.4 (Oxford, Magdalen College, 149, fol. 5rb): 'puplice legerem in theologia'; quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 8n36; @riedlinger:1958makellosigkeit, p. 322n4].<!--McDonough Cappella or Suppletio also had a citation that was interesting on Oxford--> It is now natural to think that anyone known to have moved to Oxford would have done so primarily to participate in its educational system. Around 1190, this was not necessarily the case. At this time, Lincoln or Northampton had as much potential as a future university centre. It was not the schools that would attract a cleric to Oxford, but its ecclesiastical courts [@southern:1984schools, pp. 16–26]; these are now thought to have given Oxford an advantage over its rivals, especially in the study of canon law [@vanliere:2003study]. Reflecting later in life, it is Paris, St Albans (representing both his birthplace and one of his first teaching posts), and the abbey at Cirencester that Alexander names as most intellectually stimulating [*Laus diuine sapientie* 11.317–44, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 509; cited and translated in @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 5–6]. He could likely have found better positions at other schools in the late twelfth century, and it seems just as likely that he went there specifically to investigate and eventually join the Augustinians. Having made a pact with one of his fellow students to become a religious (presumably dating to his time at Paris, from around 1177 until 1183), there would have been no reason to delay until he was over forty.[^forty]

[^forty]: *Laus beatissime uirginis* 8.15 (Oxford, Magdalen College, 149, fol. 179vb):

    > At tu cuius faciem ruga senilis arat. cuius genua
    labant⍪ egressus titubant⸵ curie
    negotiis imlicaris. Et ecce dum tua mens tot
    inuoluit se curis ad radicem arboris iam posita est
    securis⸵ et tu sompnis audes indulgere securis? Militauimus
    pariter in castris philosophie. et condixeramus
    nos simul ingressuros fore tabernaculum sapientie.
    Sed ecce uitis generosa degenerauit in labruscam
    et philosophus qui aporismatibus arismetice diutius
    inuigilauerat⸵ fisci ratiociniis detinetur.

    \noindent Quoted in part in @hunt:1984schools [p. 9n41], who compares it to @cartellieri:1898donaueschinger [pp. 15–16 (nos. 68–69)].

Hunt's suggestion that Alexander became a canon in 1197 is based solely on a letter of Peter of Blois, congratulating master Alexander of St Albans on having taken up monastic vows [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 11–12]. He commends Alexander on having given up the 'honour of a master' [Peter of Blois, Ep. 137, @giles:1847petri, p. 2:22: 'honorem magisterii']; as canons did not cease to use the title 'magister', the recipient had apparently ceased to be the master of a school, which more logically points to St Albans rather than Oxford in the context of what is known about Alexander's life. Peter of Blois began to circulate letter collections around 1184, but this epistle occurs in a second recension, traditionally dated *c.*1197 [as @southern:1984schools, p. 25], but now thought to have been compiled between 1198 and 1205 [@cotts:2009clerical, pp. 281-284 summarizes the debate]. This only circumscribes the latest possible date of its composition, and Peter is known to have added earlier letters to his collections. Peter's reference to 'your writing, and the scent of your most famous praiseworthy reputation' [Peter of Blois, Ep. 137, @giles:1847petri, p. 2:22: 'litteratura siquidem uestra, et famae commendabilioris celeberrimus odor'] indicates that Alexander had already produced a substantial body of writing: it is his *De utensilibus*, *Nouus Esopus*, *Nouus Auianus*, and verses that Peter is most likely to have admired. It is also possible that Alexander had already gained a reputation for his knowledge of the Wisdom books – 'you have put out your hand to strong things', Peter writes [Peter of Blois, Ep. 137, @giles:1847petri, p. 2:22: 'manum tuam misisti ad fortia']. This refers to Prov. 31:19, concerning the strong woman that forms the subject of Alexander's *Tractatus super mulierem fortem*. This letter shows that Alexander became a canon in the midst of his teaching and writing career, but does not indicate where or when this occurred.

The only other known evidence for the date of Alexander's conversion is found in papal letters. Pope Celestine III names 'magister Alexander de Sancto Albano' as a papal judge-delegate on 23 January 1195 [@holtzmann:1930papsturkunden, p. 1:619 (no. 320)]. Innocent III names him 'magister Alexander de Sancto Albano, canonicus Cirecesterie', on 8 May 1203 [@madox:1702formulare, pp. 25–26 (no. 45); @cheney:1967letters, p. 77 (no. 471); cf. @sayers:1971papal, p. 121]. Hunt argues that this indicates Alexander must have become a canon in the intervening period [@hunt:1984schools, p. 11]. This assumes too much consistency on the part of the papal administration; the Cirencester cartulary itself freely refers to 'magister Alexander' or 'Alexander abbas'. Augustinians frequently functioned as judges-delegate [for the example of Alexander of Ashby, see @dinkovabruun:2001alexander, pp. 306–311], and the letter of Celestine III might equally be taken as evidence that Alexander was already involved in the order at this time, if one notes that it concerns Llanthony Priory, an Augustinian foundation. He was later involved in defending this house in a dispute with the earl of Hereford [@richardson:1941select, pp. clxxix–clxxxi; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 13; translated in @rothwell:1996english, p. 863].

Alexander was certainly a canon by the time he wrote *Super psalterium*, which, as Hunt himself notes, also has a distinctly scholastic feel [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 97–103]. He writes of his friends that tried to dissuade him from joining a religious order, and hints in *Solatium fidelis anime* at the time he spent examining the customs of different religious orders [cited in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 9–10]. This story from Caesarius of Heisterbach might perhaps date from this time:

> On a certain day Master Alexander, surnamed Neckam, had come into a convent of black monks. Some of them asked for the sake of the customary how long he would present the word of God in the chapter, and he promised; others asked him, 'Good master, speak to us briefly.' To them he responded, 'Gladly.' Reflecting that they would listen less gladly, he entered the chapter house. And when he had sat down, he burst forth in these words of the Lord, saying, '"Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God." But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.' And he added, 'Is that sermon brief enough for you, brothers?' And then, rising, he went out, leaving them not a little perplexed.[^caesarius]

[^caesarius]: @hilka:1933wundergeschichten [pp. 1:120-121]; @schönbach:1902über [p. 77]; cited in @hunt:1984schools [p. 15]:

Et adiecit: 'Estne satis breuis sermo iste, fratres?' Moxque surgens exiuit, non modicum illis confusis.
    </div>

\noindent It is possible to see from Alexander's works that there was a time when he was not himself a religious, but preaching to monks; and that he was writing literature designed for schools even after having become a canon. Hunt draws the conclusion from *Super psalterium* that it is written essentially in a lecture format, unlike the works Alexander is certainly known to have produced at Cirencester; but that he cannot have been at Oxford while writing it, because he refers to himself as cloistered in the text. As can be seen in chapter 5, the booklet of [Oxford, Jesus College, 94] containing the *Glose* was likely produced at Oxford. There is no reason that he could not have been both a lecturer and an Augustinian at St Frideswide's.

The problem of Alexander's role in Oxford is compounded by a lack of evidence for when he arrived there. The cartularies for the Augustinian abbeys in Oxford provide slender documentation for this period; it is not even possible to determine the dates of its priors in the late twelfth century [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:180, 1:284]. Rigg points out that Alexander shares a story of a barnacle goose with Gerald of Wales' *Topographia hibernica*, and that he might thus have been present at Oxford by 1188 to hear Gerald's recitation of this work [@rigg:1992history, p. 177].

The earliest datable record for Alexander's time at Oxford is an Ascension Day sermon given at St Frideswide's, on which occasion it was customary for the people to make gifts to the church. The need was particularly urgent at this time, it had burned in a fire of 1190 along with a large part of the town, as reported by the annals of Oseney Abbey [@luard:1864annales, p. 4:43], though this report is now thought to be exaggerated, and the church was not entirely destroyed [@halsey:198812thcentury, pp. 134–135]. Nonetheless, the work required was substantial, still visible in the present Christ Church [@blair:1988frideswides, pp. 240–242], and Pope Celestine III issued a bull in support of the campaign in 1194 [@wigram:1895cartulary, pp. 1:41–42 (no. 39)]. Alexander presumably delivered the sermon between these dates [@southern:1984schools, p. 22; @salter:1936medieval, p. 37], though it should be noted that there is no specific mention of a fire [@halsey:198812thcentury, p. 134]. He exhorts the people of Oxford to restore the church, in a humorous play on the liturgical text:

> I grieve, brothers, that 'this place' of the church of St Frideswide 'is awful' now and horrible because of the ruin of its walls. Why do you not consider, you laymen, that it is literally said, 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house'? Why therefore do you not love the beauty of the house of the Lord?[^locus]

\noindent Alexander frequently uses the phrase 'uiri fratres' to address his audience in some of his sermons, and especially in his meditative commentaries; it is usually assumed to refer to his fellow canons. He appears to have borrowed the phrase from the Acts of the Apostles (1:16, 2:29, 2:37, etc.); it occasionally appears elsewhere, as in the letters of Alcuin, but no other medieval author is so fond of it as a catchphrase. Here, it can be understood as his method of catching the attention of different parts of his audience. He first addresses the canons of St Frideswide, as equals, and then the laity; this also occurs elsewhere in his sermons [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 89, 92–93]. The phrase also appears in the course of a sermon in which Alexander was once again obliged to berate the people of Oxford for their miserliness.[^miserliness] This sermon provides insight into the town's self-perception as a learned centre, quoting both biblical and classical passages. The use of the double address in Oxford strongly suggests that Alexander was himself a canon of St Frideswide's by this time.

Some sermons indicate that they were delivered before Alexander joined the Augustinian canons, but there is no evidence that they were given in Oxford. Two sermons also show him addressing monks in a highly complementary manner, and as an outsider. In the first of these (not necessarily earlier in chronology), he frames himself as *scholaris*.[^scholaris] This sermon includes many of Alexander's favourite topics in praise of holy women, and its description of his consideration of the monastic life might almost suggest that it was given on the occasion of his conversion. The second sermon includes many of the same sentiments, but does not indicate Alexander's own state.[^state] It may have been given at Oxford before he became as canon, but might equally have been given during his time at St Albans or even Paris. Hunt believed that most of Alexander's sermons dated to his time at Oxford [@hunt:1984schools, p. 84], but it is shown below (under '[Walter's edition of Alexander's sermons]') that they were instead compiled at Cirencester after his death.

Alexander's sermons – the only of his writings that can be unambiguously associated with Oxford – consistently suggest that he became a canon there rather than at Cirencester, and much earlier than 1197. It is even theoretically possible but unlikely that he was already a canon at Dunstable, where there was an Augustinian priory, and that he received temporary permission to live outside a community while at St Albans [an Alexander only occurs in the Dunstable cartulary around the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, and there is nothing to identify him with Alexander Neckam: @fowler:1926digest, pp. 18, 111 (nos. 1, 324)]. Such permission was granted infrequently [@dickinson:1950origins, p. 229], and the masters of the school at St Albans were usually seculars [@leach:1915schools, pp. 116–118]. Certainly, as his writings show, he had already begun to align himself with 'uiris claustralibus' while continuing to participate in the life of the schools.

## The intellectual culture of St Frideswide's

Oxford was one of the most exciting places in England to be an Augustinian in the late twelfth century. It included the priory of St Frideswide's, re-established in 1122; Oseney Abbey, founded 1129 [@postles:1987patronus]; and St George's, absorbed by Oseney *c.*1149 [@smith:1980lincoln, p. 130 (no. 208); @barron:2002augustinian], in addition to the foundations elsewhere in Oxfordshire at Bicester, Cold Norton, Dorchester, and Wroxton, and possibly other smaller cells [@blair:1988thornbury]. St Frideswide's had formerly been a mixed house of secular canons; Guimund, previously a royal chaplain [@green:1986government, p. 176n170], was the first Augustinian prior from 1122 to *c.*1139 [@knowles:2001heads, p. 1:180], whom William of Malmesbury praised as having transformed the house from a small collection of clerics 'who were living as they pleased' [@winterbottom:2007william, 4.178.4: 'qui pro libito uiuerent']. Ralph, the first prior of Oseney, had come from St Frideswide's [@knowles:2001heads, p. 1:179; @postles:1985learning, p. 33], but the Augustinians in Oxford did not always cooperate. The cartulary and annals of Oseney Abbey report a dispute with St Frideswide's over the investiture of the church of St Mary Magdalen in 1147–51, 1173–76, and 1200, requiring papal intervention on each occasion. The church had been part of St George's, and the canons of St Frideswide had grounds to question whether this remained the case following its absorption after Roger of Salisbury declared that he had given the church to St Frideswide's [@salter:1929cartulary, pp. 2:214–234 (nos. 780–794); @luard:1864annales, pp. 4:25–27, 4:37–38, 4:50; @cheney:1967letters, p. 45 (no. 276); @barron:2002augustinian, p. 238]. While the canons' precise activities remain uncertain, they were deeply involved in the town's affairs.

At St Frideswide's, Alexander was likely inspired by the life and works of Robert of Cricklade. Robert became an Augustinian canon at Cirencester (13 km north-west of Cricklade), witnessing a charter between 1136 and 1139 as 'magistro Roberto de Krickel’’ [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:337 (no. 372/423)]. Robert wrote his *De connubio patriarche Iacob* at Cirencester between 1135 and 1140. In the preface, addressed to Lawrence of Westminster, he looks back at a career that sounds similar to that of Alexander, explaining why he has sent this book rather than a copy of his *Defloratio naturalis historie Plinii secundi*: 'While still a scholar, devoted to the guidance of the schools, you asked me to send you a little book that I had composed, though I suppose it has escaped your memory. I promised. But lest it should offend the dignity of your most pious soul, given the playful readings that it is filled with, I preferred to become a false promiser.'[^escaped] In the same work, he also praises William of Malmesbury's *Defloratio Gregorii*, *De miraculis beatae uirginis Mariae*, and *Commentary on Lamentations*: he liked these works so well that he had copies made for Cirencester [*De connubio* 2.22, cited in @hunt:1936english, pp. 31–32; @thomson:2003william, p. 74 dates this to March 1137, though the rationale is unclear; cf. @winterbottom:2011willelmi, p. x]. He held Cirencester in enough esteem that he gave his lands in Cricklade to the abbey, 'in which I took up the habit of a canon', while he was prior of St Frideswide's [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:418 (no. 473/729): 'in qua habitum canonici suscepi'], a position he gained in 1138 or 1139 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:180, 1:284]. This was a period of transition for the Oxford Augustinians: Master Wigod also became prior of Oseney in 1138 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:179]. The date of Robert's death is unknown. 'Vir erat antiquus', writes Gerald of Wales in *De principis instructione* [@warner:1891principis, pp. xi, 65]. His last certain occurrence is in 1174 [cited in @knowles:2001heads, p. 1:180; @emden:1957biographical, pp. 1:513–14]. He was presumably dead before 1180, as he is not present in the list of delegates present at the translation of Frideswide on 12 February 1180 written by his successor, Philip, who describes himself as prior [Philip of Oxford, *De miraculis sancte Frideswide* 1, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Digby 177, fols 1v–2r: partially quoted in @blair:1987saint, p. 118]. It is unlikely that Alexander knew Robert in person, but he probably read his books at St Frideswide's and later Cirencester, and Robert's high regard for Cirencester must have helped to maintain a close alliance between the houses, with the abbey continuing to make new copies of his works in the early thirteenth century.

Robert's approach to writing is remarkably similar to Alexander's; he seeks to take old material and present it in new ways for a modern audience [for manuscripts of unpublished works, see @sharpe:1997handlist, pp. 532-533]. *De connubio patriarche Iacob* is an allegorical interpretation of the story of Jacob, which he later describes as dealing with the conflict of the virtues against the vices, alongside contemplation.^[*Speculum fidei*, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 380, fol. 132v.] His *Homiliae super Ezechielem* also focus on allegory, in which he occasionally disagrees with the interpretations of Richard of St Victor of the same book. *Speculum fidei* is dedicated to Robert, the second earl of Leicester, whom he addresses throughout the work, aiming to set out a summary of Christianity based on the evidence of the Old and New Testaments, with the interpretation of the church fathers.^[*Speculum fidei*, prol: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, 380, fol. 2r.] It is best known for condemning Peter Lombard as a 'heretic' based on his Christology, in a passage that suggests Robert was educated at Paris [@hunt:1936english, pp. 32–33, with the text of fols 62r–63r at 37–38]. At Oxford, he wrote *Defloratio naturalis historie Plinii secundi*, which as he explains in the prologue seeks to rationalize Pliny's work and make it more comprehensible [@näf:2002roberti, pp. 2–3; also quoted in @vanhouts:2006femmes, pp. 111–112; @holland:1890university, p. 161]. Robert also wrote hagiography: his *Vita et miracula Sancta Thomae Cantuariensis* is lost, but was the foundation for a rendition in Old Norse [@orme:1966reconstruction]. During his time as prior, he also raised the profile of the priory's patron saint to turn it into a centre of pilgrimage, perhaps encouraged by his own experience of healing at the shrine of Thomas Becket [described in his a letter to Benedict of Peterborough: @robertson:1875materials, pp. 96–101].

One of the most notable features of Alexander's later work is his enthusiasm for studying the women of the Bible, perhaps prompted by his love for his mother, Hoderna [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 1–2]; Oxford's approach to St Frideswide or Frithuswith may also have fostered this interest. The abbess appears as a precocious child in two twelfth-century lives [both passages are translated in @blair:1987saint, pp. 74-75]. In 'Life A', from *c.*1100–30, she learns the Psalter in six months [Life A §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 96: seven months in Oxford, Balliol College, 228; @blair:2004frithuswith, p. 32]; 'Life B', an expanded version dated to *c.*1140–70 and attributed to Robert of Cricklade, reduces this to five months and emphasizes the extent of the improvement this wrought on her character, reflecting the highest medieval ideals for learning [Life B §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 103; on the attribution to Robert, see @blair:1987saint, p. 80]. Indeed, Robert explicitly elevates Frideswide beyond the capacities of any child: 'England was agog; all marvelled to see the frail sex at so young an age surpassing masculine strength' [Life B §4: @blair:1987saint, p. 104 (translation from his comparison with Life A, 75): 'Stupet Anglia, mirantur uniuersi, infirmum cernentes sexum in etate tenera robur excessisse uirile'].

Prior Philip, Robert's successor, continued to promote the cult [his work is described in @yarrow:2006saints, pp. 177–188]. In the priory seal from *c.*1190 [as @blair:2004frithuswith; 'mid to late 1180s' according to @heslop:1988late, pp. 271–272], Frideswide holds a set of wax tablets in her left hand, and a fleur-de-lis in her right [reproduced from four Oxford charters in @wigram:1895cartulary, p. 1:ii; composite drawing from London, British Library, Seal Cast LXX.79 in @heslop:1988late, p. 272; @clark:1889survey, p. 2:159 described this as a 'picture of a doctor with a kind of cope']. This connects her equally with the typical female personifications of the liberal arts and the church, as much as with ecclesiastical administration [@heslop:1988late, p. 271–272].

For Alexander, who wished to take up religious vows but also had a deeply practical bent, as visible in works such as *De utensilibus*, the Augustinians were an ideal match; in the Augustinian community, he was able to continue teaching while pursuing a purer existence. He described his choice as a middle way between the earthly life of scholarship and the heavenly life:

> The life of the cloistered is in between the life of scholars and the life of the triumphant. I slept therefore 'in the middle of lots' [Ps. 67.14], that is in the middle of fates. For one fate of grace is the honour of the life of scholars; the final fate is the delicious joy of the life of the triumphant; in the middle is the tranquillity of the cloistered.[^LBV.2.16]

[^LBV.2.16]: *Laus beatissime uirginis* 2.16 (Oxford, Magdalen College, 149, fol. 79rb), cited by @hunt:1984schools [p. 9n43]:

    <div lang="la">
    > Vita claustralium media est inter uitam scolarium⸵ et uitam triumphantium. Dormi igitur *inter medios cleros* hoc est in medio sortium. Est enim quedam sors gratie honestas uite scolarium sors ultima est⸵ delitiosa iocunditas uite triumphantium⸵ media tranquillitas claustralium.
    </div>

\noindent The generic terminology Alexander uses reflects an aim to write not for a specifically Augustinian or even monastic audience. Robert of Cricklade similarly took a conciliatory towards his monastic colleagues, though was much more aware, perhaps even proud, of the difference between canons and monks: 'I am not jealous of writing monks, but I rejoice with them, although I am not a monk, but the most unworthy of the canons of Cirencester'.[^unworthy] Alexander both heaped praise upon other orders and continued to write works specifically designed for the schools, such as *Sacerdos ad altare*, well after his conversion. It is this ability to straddle the worlds of the scholars and the cloistered that Alexander gained from the Augustinians in Oxford. It is often argued that the Augustinians had little influence in the development of the University of Oxford, and the likelihood that one of its earliest known lecturers was also a canon suggests it is time to reconsider this history.

## Alexander at Cirencester

Alexander's move to St Mary’s Abbey in Cirencester is usually portrayed as a sort of retirement [e.g. @thomson:1988alexander, p. ix], as if his new situation gave him time away from the jurors, scholars, and prelates to concentrate on writing. While his departure from Oxford may have been a relief in some respects (there is no indication that he was obliged to berate the people of Cirencester for their stinginess), it is unlikely that he was any less busy after the move. With perhaps forty canons resident, Cirencester was one of the largest Augustinian foundations in England [@knowles:1948religious, p. 2:259]. The earliest mention of Alexander in the Cirencester cartulary, datable between 1200 and 1203, presents him as one of the primary advisors to the abbot [@ross:1964cartulary, pp. 1:295–96 (no. 327); @cheney:1986canterburya, pp. 77–78 (no. 410) explains the dating]; there is also a mention of him as prior in a later manuscript [London, British Library, Add. 11284, fol. 65r, cited by @wedge:1967alexander, p. 16n59]. Surviving charters indicate that the abbey suffered an administrative crisis late in the twelfth century. It required the involvement of Pope Innocent III, who issued a letter in 1199 to enforce safeguards and prevent interference by external prelates [@ross:1964cartulary, pp. 1:162–163 (no. 164/96); @cheney:1967letters, p. 20 (no. 112)]. Such a turbulent environment would not have been suited to a new recruit, nor does the position given to Alexander suggest he was a novice. Indeed, it is possible that Alexander was specifically sent to Cirencester to support the reform.

When Alexander later became the abbot of Cirencester in 1213, a position he held until his death in 1217 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:159–60, with corrections at 1:278], he became a powerful figure who was also lord of the manor by royal prerogative [on the early relationship between the abbots and the townspeople, see @rollison:2011commune, chap. 1; @fuller:1884cirencester]. He was the sixth to hold this position since the reconstitution of the abbey by Henry I in 1117 [on the abbey's early history, see @wilkinson:1998cirencester; @evans:1993cirencester]. He seems to have been a successful administrator, initiating the fall fair for which Cirencester later earned renown [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 1:38 (no. 43/7); @smith:1907itinerary, p. 1:129 (part II, fol. 24: cf. 3:101–102, part VI, fol. 65), refers to a Monday market; quoted in @willis:1718history, p. 1:61]. Yet it was not for worldly power that he moved from Oxford; after travelling to the Fourth Lateran Council, he declared that he was appalled by the curia and terrified by prelates, and simply wanted to be left alone to his books [*Laus sapientie diuine* 5.225–344, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 448; translated in @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 20–21].

Cirencester may have offered a key advantage over Oxford in its rich tradition of book production. The work of its bookmakers is now best known for their peculiarly beautiful method of creating decorated initials [@alexander:1978scribes]. One of the most remarkable features of the earlier books from Cirencester is their detailed colophons, possibly included as a reminder to the canons to pray for the souls of those who made the books and their benefactors [@webber:1998libraries, pp. xxv, 26], and as will be seen in the fourth and fifth chapters, the canons took a personal interest in ensuring the textual accuracy and readability of the books they produced. If the surviving volumes are representative of the library, there seems to have been a flurry of activity in bookmaking shortly after the establishment of the house, building up a library primarily composed of patristic works, as was common for the Augustinians (see appendix B below, '[Works available at Cirencester]'). The collection supported much of Alexander's thought, and inspired him towards new heights of creativity.

Until his final days, Alexander continued to define himself as a teacher. His creation of the various renditions of *Corrogationes Promethei* and *Sacerdos ad altare* later in life suggests that he continued to work with the school at Cirencester. His philosophy of writing and teaching is most visible in *Corrogationes noui Promethei*, probably one of his last works. He emphasizes that these activities reshape both the teaching writer and reading student. The first section of the poem presents an abbot who was benevolent but firm, providing instruction that would be both helpful and enjoyable:

> | Therefore let the teacher teach by deed and word;
> |     let honey-sweet words advance from the comb of his mouth.
> | Let the usefulness of his words form a foundation, the teaching of the faithful
> |     delight, but it pleases more by usefulness.[^use]

[^use]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei* 109–112, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, lat. 11867, fol. 232ra; @cropp:1991critical [pp. 167–168]:

    > |     Delectat. set plus utilitate iuuat.
    </div>

\noindent Later, he adds that teaching is the means by which he forms himself:

> | And perhaps someone will be gnawing my verses,
> |   for sometimes spite is accustomed to crawl on the ground.
> | But in writing for others I write for myself. I learn by teaching:
> |   thus I wish to be useful both to myself and others.

\noindent Teaching is the unifying strain throughout Alexander's career, and he brings this to bear on his approach to life as a regular canon. During his time at Paris, Alexander was inspired by figures such as William de Montibus, for whom he has nothing but praise [*Laus sapientie diuine* 4.835–848, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 460; @goering:1992william, p. 6–7; @hunt:1984schools, p. 27], to bring the latest in scholastic theology to bear on practical pastoral matters. Given their position in the midst of the secular and monastic worlds, the Augustinians were ideally placed to lead in this, which became a true movement with the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. For his part, Alexander embarked on an innovative new series of writings that combined his scholastic and cloistered experience.
