# The Unity of Alexander's Career and His Literary Works

One of the most difficult problems of the history of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is understanding the relationship between the educational institutions associated with scholasticism and monastic establishments. It was commonplace until recently to assume that one could make a clean division between the two. This view is encouraged in some ways by medieval writers themselves, as in Serlo of Wilton's famous poem, 'Linquo coax ranis', condemning the conceit of scholastic philosophers [@öberg:1965serlon, no. 78]. It has never been disputed that monastics were keenly interested in recruiting from the schools, as vividly shown in the preaching of Bernard of Clairvaux [@ferruolo:1985origins, p. 47]. But even where religious communities existed in close proximity to the schools in the twelfth century, it is often assumed that they wanted nothing to do with one another. These assumptions have governed the twentieth-century scholarship on Alexander Neckam, and have shaped the interpretation of what he wrote.

More recent scholarship is increasingly showing that monastics were keenly interested in both reading the latest work from the schools and contributing to it. Closer examination of Alexander's career shows that one cannot separate his scholastic and monastic work. It is usually thought that Alexander joined the Augustinians when he moved to Cirencester, but there is no hard evidence for this. The available documentation fits better if it is instead assumed that he first became a regular canon at St Frideswide's Abbey in Oxford. This allows more of his writing to have taken place before he moved to Cirencester, providing a less precise but more realistic chronology for his works. While it is often argued that the Augustinians had little influence in the development of the University of Oxford, the idea that one of its earliest known lecturers was also a canon prompts a reconsideration of this history.

## Dating Alexander's writings by genre

There are only a handful of absolute chronological indicators in Alexander's writings, meaning that one must use these in combination with cross-references between his works to determine the period in which they were written. R.W. Hunt was the first critic to assess all of Alexander Neckam's works, and in his book *The Schools and the Cloister* he struck upon what seems to modern readers an obvious distinction between the works: many of his works are clearly designed for teaching purposes, whereas others exhibit a highly discursive style that is typically associated with monastic writers. He presents the following 'approximate chronological groups' for dating Alexander's works [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 125-126]:

i. Early Writings, *c.* 1177–*c.* 1190

    *c.* 1177+
    : *De nominibus utensilium*
    : Commentary on Martianus Capella
    : *Nouus Auianus*
    : *Nouus Esopus*

ii. Oxford Period, *c.* 1190–*c.* 1197

    *c.* 1190+
    : Commentary on the Athanasian Creed
    : Questiones
    : Sermons

iii. Canon of Cirencester, *c.* 1197–1213

    *c.* 1197+
    : *Laus beatissime uirginis*
    : *Solatium fidelis anime*
    : *Corrogationes Promethei*
    : *Corrogationes Promethei* versified
    : Gloss on the Psalter

    pre-1205
    : *De naturis rerum et in Ecclesiasten*

    1199–1210
    : *Sacerdos ad altare*

    pre-1213
    : Commentary on Proverbs
    : Commentary on the Song of Songs
    : *Speculum speculationum*

    *c.* 1213
    : *Laus sapientie diuine*

iv. Abbot of Cirencester, 1213–1217

    1213+
    : *Corrogationes noui Promethei*
    : *Super mulierem fortem*

    1216–17
    : *Suppletio defectuum*

v. Undated: *De commendatione uini*, hymns, minor verses, *Meditatio de Magdalena*, *Exhortatio ad religiosos*

vi. Undated and lost: *De nuptiis Mercurii*, *Epistola ad discipulum*, *Passio sancti Albani*

This scheme neatly sums up Hunt's argument concerning Alexander: that he began as a student in Paris, and spent much of his career (from *c.* 1177 to *c.* 1197) as a teacher. After a complete change in mindset from scholastic to monastic, he was finally able to retire to Cirencester to focus on writing for around sixteen years of his life, until his career as an author was largely consumed by administrative duties for the last four years of his life as an abbot.

This scheme is tidy, but unrealistic once one considers the sheer bulk of the material being assigned to Cirencester, presenting a writer who had supposedly only produced a handful of short works in the prime of his youth but nonetheless became famous for these, and suddenly flourished after never having written a fully original long-form work. Further, the date of 1197 is based purely on a letter of Peter of Blois congratulating Alexander taking up vows; Alexander may have arrived in Cirencester as late as 1203. Moreover, the abbey cartulary shows that he was heavily involved in the affairs of the abbey even before becoming its abbot. A span that might be as short as ten years is far too little time to produce works of such length and originality as Alexander's commentaries on Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs, as well as *Speculum speculationum*, not to mention the vast amount of research that *Corrogationes Promethei* would have required. The chronology appears to require that he must have started drafting these writing well in advance – but if his later work can indeed be distinguished by its monastic character, he must have become a canon well before 1197.

Several more corrections can also be made to Hunt's list based on additional references of which he was unaware. None of Alexander's works up to his gloss on the Psalter are securely datable, and are presented as earlier writings due to their lack of cross-references to his other books, and their occasionally derivative character. Hunt took attributions to 'master Alexander of St Albans' as a sign of an early date, though this needs to be treated with the usual caution, especially since this appears in some copies of *De naturis rerum* [see list in @hunt:1984schools, p. 135], demonstrably finished at Cirencester. Omitting Alexander's sermons and minor verses, which were presumably written throughout his life, his life and works can now tentatively be presented as follows:

i. Teacher at Dunstable and St Albans, *c.* 1183–*c.* 1190 [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 3–4 presents the evidence for Alexander having arrived at Dunstable in 1183, based on Matthew Paris, and suggests that he was probably at Paris from *c.* 1175–82]

    *c.* 1183+
    : *De utensilibus* [@hunt:1991teaching, p. 1:178 prints the standard *accessus* to the work, which specifies this title, also used in several manuscripts; its usual form, *De nominibus utensilium*, seems to have been popularized only because it appears in the manuscript used for the first edition, @wright:1857treatise, p. 1:96]
    : *Nouus Esopus*
    : *Nouus Auianus* [appears to include some borrowings from *Nouus Esopus*: @klein:1998alexander, p. 105]

ii. Teacher at Oxford (and canon at St Frideswide's?), *c.* 1190–*c.* 1195

    *c.* 1190+
    : Commentary on Martianus Capella^[This work is closest in style to Alexander's commentaries on the Athanasian Creed and the Psalter, but may have been written at an earlier date.]
    : *Expositio simboli Athanasii episcopi* [Manuscripts refer to the author as either 'Magister Alexander Nequam' or 'Magister Alexander de sancto Albano': @hunt:1984schools, pp. 129–130]
    : *Questiones*^[The sole manuscript, Lambeth, Palace Library, 421, fol. 124va, refers to the author as 'Alexandrum de sancto Albano'.]

    1193+
    : *Glose super Psalterium* [earliest manuscripts have 'Magister Alexander Nequam' (reference to his abbacy in Jesus College 94 a later addition); refers to the Third Crusade: @hunt:1984schools, pp. 26-27]
    : *Solatium fidelis anime*^[Appears to refer to the gloss on the Psalter at fol. 26va. This work is placed here because *Laus beatissime uirginis* seems to be the work in which Alexander is most concerned with reflecting on his experience at Oxford: nothing has yet been found that indicates when this work was published, but this may change with an edition.]

iii. Canon of Cirencester, *c.* 1195–1213

    pre-1205
    : *Laus beatissime uirginis* (commentary on the Song of Songs) [refers to work at Oxford in the past tense: @mcdonough:2004laus shows that these are the same works; reference to *Solatium fidelis anime*, @hunt:1984schools, p. 25]
    : *Corrogationes Promethei*
    : *Corrogationes Promethei metrice*
    : *De naturis rerum* (commentary on Ecclesiastes) [@hunt:1984schools, p. 26 notes a story written before the fall of Rouen on 24 June 1204; but @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 99–100 suggests that the book might nonetheless have been completed at a later date; 1.2 refers to *Laus beatissime uirginis*, *Solatium fidelis anime*, and *Corrogationes Promethei*, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 16]
    : *De commendatione uini* [the structure of *Sol meldunensis* as well as a letter from Peter of Blois found in @revell:1993later, no. 31, suggests that *De commendatione uini* was dedicated to Thomas Carbonel, abbot of Gloucester from 1179 until 1205: discussed in more detail below, chap. 5]

    pre-1213
    : *Meditatio de Magdalena*
    : *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*^[Refers to the *Meditatio de Magdalena* (Oxford, Jesus College 94, fol. 79ra) and *Laus beatissime uirginis* (fol. 99vb).]
    : *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis* (incomplete)^[Title refers to Alexander Neckam as canon.]
    : *Speculum speculationum* (incomplete) [title refers to Alexander as a canon: refers to *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* at 1.2.10, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 23; @thomson:1988alexander, p. ix gives 1201 as a *terminus post quem*, based on a quotation of a decretal of Innocent III]

iv. Abbot of Cirencester, 1213–17

    1213+
    : *Corrogationes noui Promethei* [written from the perspective of an abbot: cf. @cropp:1991critical, pp. 43–52]
    : *Laus sapientie diuine* [refers to the death of William de Montibus in 1213: @hunt:1984schools, p. 27; @rigg:1992history, p. 116 gives date of 1213–15; one manuscript refers to Alexander as a canon, but the text seems to have been finished after his journey to Rome: @wedge:1967alexander, pp. 19–22]
    : *Sacerdos ad altare* [refers to *Laus sapientie diuine*: @mcdonough:2010alexandri, p. ix]

    1216–17
    : *Suppletio defectuum* [refers to the death of King John in October 1216: @mcdonough:1999alexander, p. xi]

*Exhortatio ad religiosos* is not a work by Alexander Neckam, but Serlo of Wilton [@öberg:1965serlon, pp. 159–162].

Genre continues to play a role in the reconstruction of this chronology. This is most evident in the the distinction between Alexander's work at Oxford and his earlier writings. *De utensilibus*, *Nouus Esopus*, and *Nouus Auianus* are all designed to teach Latin and poetic style; *Commentum super Martianum*, *Expositio simboli Athanasii episcopi*, and *Glose super Psalterium* appear to support lectures, while *Questiones* is typical of scholastic question-literature. The year of Alexander's move to Cirencester is completely unknown: 1195 is suggested based on a guess that it would have taken around a decade to complete *Laus beatissime uirginis*, the two versions of *Corrogationes Promethei*, *De naturis rerum*, and *De commendatione uini*. The first of these works is likely based on his lectures on the Song of Songs [*Laus beatissime uirginis* 6.24, cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 8n39], and it is alternatively possible that he substantially drafted the work at Oxford.

It is defensible to argue that Alexander's commentaries on the Wisdom books were the product of his later years, and this is borne out by documentary evidence. The key problem with Hunt's argument is the assumption that the work of the schools and the cloisters could mix only to a limited degree – that if Alexander was referring to himself as having joined an abbey, as he does in his gloss on the Psalter [@hunt:1984schools, p. 27] this must mean that he had stopped teaching. Even Alexander's *Commentum super Martianum* cannot be entirely ruled out as a product of Alexander's time as an Augustinian, since in his commentary on the Song of Songs he refers to the canons' interest in the work [@mcdonough:2006alexander, p. xvi]. The Augustinian order allowed Alexander to apply his scholastic training directly to present knowledge in new ways.

## Alexander's role in Oxford

<!-- what was the line: 'legebam in scola'? Was that GP, or CCant = Hunt p. 8n36? Check Wedge. McDonough Cappella or Suppletio also had a citation that was interesting on Oxford -->

Alexander describes his teaching at Oxford as 'reading publicly in theology' ['puplice legerem in theologia', *Laus beatissime uirginis* 1.4 (Oxford, Magdalene College 149, fol. 5rb): quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 8n36]. It is only natural to think that anyone known to have moved to Oxford would have done so primarily for educational purposes. Yet around 1190, this was not necessarily true. At this time, it does not seem to have been the schools that would attract a cleric to Oxford, but its ecclesiastical courts [@southern:1984schools, pp. 16–26]. Reflecting later in life, it is Paris, St Albans, and Cirencester that he names as most intellectually stimulating [*Laus diuine sapientie* 0.0.000, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 000; cited in @wedge:1967alexander, p. 000]. He could likely have found better positions at other schools in the late twelfth century, and it seems just as likely that he went there specifically to investigate and eventually join the Augustinians. Having made a pact with one of his fellow students to become a religious, there would have been no reason to delay until he was over forty ['Militauimus pariter in castris philosophie et condixeramus nos simul ingressuros fore tabernaculum sapientie. Set ecce uitis generosa degenerauit in labruscam et philosophus qui aporismatibus arismetice diutius inuigilauerat fisci ratiociniis detinetur.' *Laus beatissime uirginis* 8.15 (Oxford, Magdalene College 149, fol. 179vb): quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 9n41<!--CHECK MS-->].

Although the most straightforward reading of Alexander's work suggests that he was an Augustinian at Oxford, Hunt assumed that he did not become a canon until moving to Cirencester [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 9–12]. This reflects the historiography of the early twentieth century: most of the research on medieval Oxford from the early twentieth century discouraged any notion that religious communities had any interest in being involved in its schools. Herbert Salter conducted particularly extensive research on the Augustinians in Oxford [@salter:1936medieval; @salter:1929cartulary; @salter:1929medieval; @salter:1922chapters; @salter:1919geoffrey], and came to the conclusion that their influence was limited to that of landlords; if anything, he argued, they had a negative effect on the university. The evidence for his view comes mainly from fourteenth- and fifteenth-century sources: the is comparatively little documentation for the Augustinians in the twelfth century, and more recent research has suggested that the canons took a much more active role [@postles:1985learning; @postles:1987patronus; @postles:1993austin; @barron:2002augustinian].

The suggestion that Alexander became a canon in 1197 is based solely on a letter of Peter of Blois, congratulating master Alexander of St Albans on having taken up monastic vows [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 11–12]. He commends Alexander on having given up the 'honorem magisterii' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)]: as monastics did not cease to use the title 'magister', the recipient had apparently ceased to be the magister of a school, which might have been at either St Alban or Oxford. Peter of Blois began to circulate letter collections around 1184, but this epistle occurs in a second recension, traditionally dated *c.* 1197 [as @southern:1984schools, p. 25], but now thought to have been compiled between 1198 and 1205 [@cotts:2009clerical, pp. 281-284 summarizes the debate]. This only circumscribes the latest possible date of its composition, and Peter is known to have added earlier letters to his collections. Peter's phrase 'litteratura siquidem uestra, et famae commendabilioris celeberrimus odor' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)] indicates that Alexander had already produced a substantial body of writing: it is his *De utensilibus*, *Nouus Esopus*, *Nouus Auianus*, and verses that Peter is most likely to have admired. It is also possible that Alexander had already gained a reputation for his work on the Wisdom books – 'manum tuam misisti ad fortia', Peter writes [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)], referring to the *mulierem fortem* in Prov. 31:19. This letter shows that Alexander became a canon in the midst of his teaching and writing career, but does not indicate where or when this occurred.
<!-- check [@taliadoros:2011communities] -->

The only other known evidence for the date of Alexander's conversion is found in papal letters. Pope Celestine III names 'magister Alexander de Sancto Albano' as a papal judge-delegate on 23 January 1195 [@holtzmann:1930papsturkunden, p. 1:619 (no. 320)]. Innocent III names him 'magister Alexander de Sancto Albano, canonicus Cirecesterie', on 8 May 1203 [@madox:1702formulare, pp. 25–26 (no. 45); @cheney:1967letters, p. 77 (no. 471); cf. @sayers:1971papal, p. 121; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 11]. Hunt argues that this indicates Alexander must have become a canon in the intervening period. This assumes too much consistency on the part of the papal administration; the Cirencester cartulary itself freely refers to 'magister Alexander' or 'Alexander abbas'. Indeed, if one notes that the letter of Celestine III concerns Llanthony Priory, an Augustinian foundation, it might equally be taken as evidence that Alexander was already involved in the order at this time; he was later involved in defending this house in a dispute with the earl of Hereford [@richardson:1941select, p. clxxix–clxxxi; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 13; translated in @rothwell:1996english, p. 863].

Alexander was certainly a canon by the time he wrote his *Glose super Psalterium*, which, as Hunt notes, has a distinctly scholastic feel [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 97–103]. He writes of his friends that tried to dissuade him from joining a religious order, and hints in *Solatium fidelis anime* at the time he spent examining the customs of different religious orders [cited in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 9–10]. One wonders if this story from Caesarius of Heisterbach might date from this time:

> Cum die quadam magister Alexander, cognomento Nequam, uenisset in quendam conuentum nigrorum monachorum et quidam ex eis ob consuetudinem peterent, quatinus in capitulo uerbum dei proponeret, illeque promisisset, alii eum sequentes dixerunt: 'Bone magister, loquimini nobis breuiter.' Quibus respondit: 'Libenter.' Considerans quod minus libenter audirent, capitulum intrauit. Qui cum resedisset, in hec uerba domini erupit dicens: '*Qui ex deo est, uerba dei audit; propterea uos non auditis, quia ex deo non estis.*^[John 8:47] Tu autem, domine, miserere nostri.' Et adiecit: 'Estne satis breuis sermo iste, fratres?' Moxque surgens exiuit, non modicum illis confusis. [quoted in @hilka:1933wundergeschichten, pp. 1:120-121; @schönbach:1902über, p. 77; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 15]
>
> On a certain day Master Alexander, surnamed Neckam, had come into a convent of black monks. Some of them asked for the sake of the customary how long he would present the word of God in the chapter, and he promised; others asked him, 'Good master, speak to us briefly.' To them he responded, 'Gladly.' Reflecting that they would listen less gladly, he entered the chapter house. And when he had sat down, he burst forth in these words of the Lord, saying, '"Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God." But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.' And he added, 'Is that sermon brief enough for you, brothers?' And then, rising, he went out, leaving them not a little perplexed.

It is possible to see from Alexander's works that there was a time when he was not himself a religious, but preaching to monks; and that he was writing literature designed for schools even after having become a canon. Hunt's conclusion from the *Glose super Psalterium* is that they are essentially in a lecture format, much unlike the works he is certainly known to have produced at Cirencester; but that because he refers to himself as cloistered, he cannot have been at Oxford. In reality, there is no reason that he could not have been both a lecturer and an Augustinian at St Frideswide's.

The problem of Alexander's role in Oxford is compounded by a lack of evidence for when he arrived there. The cartularies for the Augustinian abbeys in Oxford provide very slender documentation for this period; it is not even possible to determine the dates of its priors in the late twelfth century [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:180, 1:284]. Rigg points out that Alexander shares a story of a barnacle goose with Gerald of Wales' *Topographia hibernica*, and that he might thus have been present at Oxford by 1188 to hear Gerald's recitation of the work [@rigg:1992history, p. 177]. The earliest datable record for Alexander's time at Oxford is an Ascension Day sermon given between 1191 and 1193 [@salter:1936medieval, p. 37; @southern:1984schools, p. 22<!-- check S: any reason for 1193, or is it a typo?-->]. It was evidently customary on this occasion for the people of Oxford to make gifts to the church. The need was particularly urgent at this time, as St Frideswide's had burned in a fire of 1190 along with a large part of the town, as reported by the annals of Oseney Abbey [@luard:1864annales, p. 4:43], and later a papal letter was required to support the rebuilding campaign.<!-- ref: Southern? Wedge? --> Alexander exhorts the people of Oxford to restore the church:

> Doleo uiri fratres quod *locus iste*^[Exod. 3.5] ecclesie sancte Frideswide. terribilis est modo et horribilis propter ruinam murorum. Quare non cogitatis o laici. quia ad litteram dictum est. *Domine dilexi decorem domus tue.*^[Ps. 25.8] Quare igitur non diligitis decorem domus domini? [Sermo in die ascencionis Christi (no. 98), Oxford, Bodleian Library, Wood empt. 13, fol. 93v: cited in @halsey:198812thcentury, 134; @salter:1936medieval, p. 37; @hunt:1984schools, p. 7]
>
> I grieve, brothers, that 'this place' of the church of St Frideswide is terrible now and horrible because of the ruin of its walls. Why do you not consider, you laymen, that it is literally said, 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house'? Why therefore do you not love the beauty of the house of the Lord?

Here, Alexander first addresses the canons of St Frideswide as an equal, followed by the laity; this also occurs elsewhere in his sermons [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 89, 92–93]. He uses the phrase 'uiri fratres' constantly to address his audience in some of his sermons and especially his meditatative commentaries, usually assumed to refer to his fellow canons. He appears to have borrowed the phrase from the Acts of the Apostles (1:16, 2:29, 2:37, etc.); it occasionally appears elsewhere, as in the letters of Alcuin, but no other medieval author is so fond of it as a catchphrase. This strongly suggests that Alexander was himself a canon of St Frideswide's by this time.

On another occasion, Alexander was once again obliged to berate the people of Oxford for their miserliness. This sermon provides insight into the town's self-perception as a learned centre, with Alexnder quoting both biblical and classical passages:

> *Cum appropinquasset Ihesus Ierosolimam uidens ciuitatem fleuit super illam. dicens. si cognouisses et tu.*^[Luke 19:41–42]<!-- something above line --> Ciues Oxonie uiri dulcissime conuersacionis ad longe maiorem morum honestorum obseruanciam tenemini⸵ quam ceteri ciues regionis istius.

Adeo ut in uobis locum habeat quod dominus in ewangelio Matthei. *Decimatis mentam et anetum. et ciminum.*^[Matt. 23:23] set maiora non uultis decimare. dicentes. *Sudore uultus nostri*^[Gen. 3:19] hec et hec adquisiuimus. nostra sunt ista. non debemus cogi decimare ista. set quero a uobis. quid detulistis in mundum? … [fol. 75v] Viri fratres nos sumus ciuitas super quam et propter quam fleuit dominus. nos monens ad simile et dicens. si cognouisses o Ierosolimam. et hoc est etiam tu fleres. sicut ego fleo. [Sermo in dominica xª post festum Trinitatis (no. 26), Oxford, Bodleian Library, Wood empt. 13, fol. 74r: cited in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 87–88]

Once again, in the context of Alexander's other sermons, the phrase 'uiri fratres' can be understood as his method of catching the attention of different parts of his audience. If Alexander became a thorn in Oxford's side, perhaps this explains in part why he would have wanted to move to Cirencester.

Alexander may not have become a canon in Oxford immediately. Two sermons also show him addressing monks in a highly complementary manner, and as an outsider. In the first of these (not necessarily earlier in chronology), he frames himself as a *scholaris*:

> *Que est ista que ascendit de deserto deliciis affluens innixa super dilectum suum?*^[Song 8:5] Spicas licet legere post manus messorum Booz. et mel cum summitatte uirge Ionathe degustare.

[Sermo in assumptione beate Marie (no. 16), Oxford, Bodleian Library, Wood empt. 13, fol. 53r: quoted in part in @hunt:1984schools, p. 87]

This sermon includes many of Alexander's favourite topics in praise of holy women, and its description of his consideration of the monastic life might almost suggest that it was given on the occasion of his conversion. The second sermon includes many of the same sentiments, but does not indicate Alexander's own state:

> *Ego sum pastor bonus bonus pastor animam suam dat^[s. *MS*] pro ouibus suis.*^[John 10:11] *Inperfectum meum uiderunt oculi tui.*^[Ps. 138:16; tui *substituted for* m. *MS*] Statum ergo inperfectionis mee et inperfectionem status mei recolligens uiris religiosis quorum *conuersacio in celis est*^[Phil. 3:20] qui cum Iocob lapidem capitibus supposuerunt predicare reformido. Vere enim predicant illi quorum opera pro ipsis predicant. immo qui operibus predicant. Maius est enim predicare opere quam sermone. Verborum tamen predicatio non solet desides excitat set et diligentes. [Dominica .i. post octauam pasche sermo (no. 30), Oxford, Bodleian Library, Wood empt. 13, fol. 86r: cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 87]

While Hunt believed that most of Alexander's sermons dated to his time at Oxford [@hunt:1984schools, p. 84], there is no particular reason why this must be so, and the latter of these sermons might equally have been given during his time at St Albans or even Paris.

While the matter cannot be absolutely resolved, the evidence suggests that Alexander became a canon earlier than Hunt's date of 1197, most likely at Oxford. Certainly, as his writings show, he had already begun to align himself with 'uiris claustralibus' while continuing to participate in the life of the schools.

## The intellectual culture of St Frideswide's

Oxford might have been one of the most exciting places in England to be an Augustinian in the late twelfth century, with the priory of St Frideswide's, re-established in 1122; Oseney Abbey, founded 1129 [@postles:1987patronus]; and St George's, absorbed by Oseney *c.* 1149 [@smith:1980lincoln, p. 130 (no. 208); @barron:2002augustinian], in addition to the foundations elsewhere in Oxfordshire at Bicester, Cold Norton, Dorchester, and Wroxton. St Frideswide's had formerly been a mixed house of secular canons; Guimund, previously a royal chaplain [@green:1986government, p. 176n170], was the first Augustinian prior from 1122 to *c.* 1139 [@knowles:2001heads, p. 1:180]. William of Malmesbury writes that he transformed the house from a small collection of clerics 'qui pro libito uiuerent' ('who were living as they pleased') [@winterbottom:2007william, 4.178.4]. Ralph, the first prior of Oseney, had come from St Frideswide's [@knowles:2001heads, p. 1:179; @postles:1985learning, p. 33], but the Augustinians in Oxford did not always cooperate. The cartulary and annals of Oseney Abbey report a dispute with St Frideswide's over the investiture of the church of St Mary Magdalene in 1147–51, 1173–76, and 1200, requiring papal intervention on each occasion; the church had been part of St George's, and the canons of St Frideswide had grounds to question whether this remained the case following its absorption after Roger of Salisbury declared that he had given the church to St Frideswide's [@salter:1929cartulary, pp. 2:214–234 (nos. 780–794); @luard:1864annales, pp. 4:25–27, 4:37–38, 4:50; @cheney:1967letters, p. 45 (no. 276); @barron:2002augustinian, p. 238]. While their precise activities remain uncertain, they were deeply involved in the town's affairs.

The obvious model for Alexander at Oxford is Robert of Cricklade. Robert became an Augustinian canon at Cirencester (13 km north-west of Cricklade), witnessing a charter between 1136 and 1139 as 'magistro Roberto de Krickel’' [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:337 (no. 372/423)]. Robert wrote his *De connubio patriarche Iacob* at Cirencester between 1135 and 1140, and his autograph<!-- correct? check cat--> copy (now Hereford, Cathedral Library, P.iv.8) remained in the abbey library. In the preface, addressed to Lawrence of Westminster, he looks back at a career that sounds similar to that of Alexander: 'Dum adhuc scolaris scolarum insisterem regimini, libellum quem composueram, sed estimo id memoria excidisse tua, tibi transmitti rogasti' ('While still a scholar, devoted to the guidance of the schools, you asked me to send you a little book that I had composed, though I suppose it had escaped your memory') [Oxford, Balliol College, MS 167, fol. 177r: quoted in @burrows:1890collectanea, p. 161<!--something may be wrong here, according to Balliol catalogue; check other MSS-->; translated in @leach:1911educational, pp. 102–103]. In the same work, he also praises William of Malmesbury's *Defloratio Gregorii*, *De miraculis beatae uirginis Mariae*, and *Commentary on Lamentations*: he liked these works so well that he had copies made for Cirencester [@hunt:1936english, pp. 31–32; @thomson:2003william, p. 74 dates this to March 1137, though the rationale for this is unclear; cf. @winterbottom:2011willelmi, p. x]. He held Cirencester in enough esteem that he gave his lands in Cricklade to the abbey, 'in qua habitum canonici suscepi' ('in which I took up the habit of a canon'), while he was prior of St Frideswide's [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:418 (no. 473/729)], a position he gained in 1138 or 1139 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:180, 1:284].<!-- check reference to EEA: 1141? --> This was a period of transition for the Oxford Augustinians: Master Wigod also became prior of Oseney in 1138 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:179]. The date of Robert's death is unknown. 'Vir erat antiquus', writes Gerald of Wales in *De principis instructione* [@warner:1891principis, pp. xi, 65]. His last certain occurrence is in 1174 [cited in @knowles:2001heads, p. 1:180; @emden:1957biographical, pp. 1:513–14]. He was presumably dead before 1180, as he is not present in the recounting of the translation of Frideswide on 12 February 1180 written by his successor, Philip, who describes himself as prior [Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Digby 177, fol. 1v<!-- check -->: edited in @blair:1987saint, p. 118]. It is unlikely that Alexander knew Robert in person, but he probably read his books at St Frideswide's and later Cirencester, and Robert's high opinion for Cirencester must have helped to maintain a close alliance between the houses, probably influencing the decision to move Alexander there.

Robert's approach to writing is remarkably similar to Alexander's, seeking to take old material and present it in new ways for a modern audience [for manuscripts of unpublished works, see @sharpe:1997handlist, pp. 532-533]. *De connubio patriarche Iacob* is an allegorical interpretation of the story of Jacob [described<!--?--> in @vanhouts:2006femmes, p. 000], which he later describes as dealing with the conflict of the virtues against the vices, alongside contemplation.^[*Speculum fidei*, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 380, fol. 132v.] His *Homiliae super Ezechielem* also focus on allegory (in which he disagrees with the interpretations of Richard of St Victor). *Speculum fidei* is dedicated to Robert de Beaumont, the second<!--?--> earl of Leicester, whom he addresses throughout the work, aiming to set out a summary of Christianity based on the evidence of the Old and New Testaments, with the interpretation of the church fathers.^[Prologue: Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 380, fol. 2r.] It is best known for condemning Peter Lombard a 'hereticum' based on his Christology, in a passage that suggests Robert was educated at Paris [@hunt:1936english, pp. 32–33, with the text of fols 62r–63r at 37–38]. At Oxford, he wrote *Defloratio naturalis historie Plinii secundi*, seeking to rationalize Pliny's work in terms that might have inspired *De naturis rerum*:

> Studiosis et precipue claustralibus et scolasticis Rodbertus Crikeladensis prior Oxinefordie non superbe sapere, sed tramitem discipline humiliter percurrere. Plinii secundi libros de naturali historia XXXVII in IX coartare uolumina conatus sum ad communem omnium ea legere uolentium utilitatem, hac usus breuitate, ut uobis satisfaciam et fastidiosis causam ocitandi tolla. placuit enim memorabiliora et utiliora conscibere, superfluis uero et nostro tempori non necessariis supersedere. quid enim prodest singularum urbium aut uiculorum siue etiam locorum nomina percurrere, cum non uiculorum siue etiam locorum nomina percurrere, cum non liceat inde tributa exigere? [@näf:2002roberti, pp. 2–3; also cited in @burrows:1890collectanea, p. 161]

Robert also wrote hagiography: his *Vita et miracula Sancta Thomae Cantuariensis* is lost, but was the foundation for a rendition in Old Norse [@orme:1966reconstruction].

Robert's life of abbess Frithuswith or St Frideswide seems to be particularly reflective of the abbey's mindset. Frideswide is shown as a precocious child in two twelfth-century lives [both passages are translated in @blair:1987saint, pp. 74-75]. In 'Life A', from *c.* 1100–30, she learns the Psalter in six months [Life A §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 96: seven months in Oxford, Balliol College, 228; @blair:2004frithuswith, p. 32]; 'Life B', an expanded version dated to *c.* 1140–70 and attributed to Robert of Cricklade, reduces this to five months and emphasizes the extent of the improvement this wrought on her character, reflecting the highest medieval ideals for learning [Life B §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 103; on the attribution to Robert, see @blair:1987saint, p. 80]. Indeed, Robert explicitly elevates Frideswide beyond the capacities of any child: 'Stupet Anglia, mirantur uniuersi, infirmum cernentes sexum in etate tenera robur excessisse uirile' ('England was agog; all marvelled to see the frail sex at so young an age surpassing masculine strength') [Life B §4: @blair:1987saint, p. 104 (translation from comparison with Life A, 75)].

Philip, Robert's sucessor, continued to promote the cult [his work is described in @yarrow:2006saints, pp. 177–188]. In the priory seal from *c.* 1190 [as @blair:2004frithuswith; 'mid to late 1180s' according to @heslop:1988late, pp. 271–272], she holds a set of wax tablets in her left hand, and a fleur-de-lis in her right [reproduced from four Oxford charters in @wigram:1895cartulary, p. 1:ii; composite drawing from London, BL Seal Cast LXX.79 in @heslop:1988late, p. 272; @clark:1889survey, p. 2:159 described this as a 'picture of a doctor with a kind of cope']. This connects her equally with the typical female personifications of the liberal arts and the church, as much as with ecclesiastical administration [@heslop:1988late, p. 271–272]. Combined with Alexander's love for his mother, Hoderna [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 1–2], this might have contribued to his enthusiasm for studying the women of the Bible.

For Alexander, who wished to take up religious vows but also had a deeply practical bent, as visible in works such as *De utensilibus*, the Augustinians were an ideal match, allowing him to continue teaching while pursuing a purer existance. He described his choice as a middle way between the earthly life of scholarship and the heavenly life:

> Vita claustralium media est inter uitam scolarium et uitam triumphantium. Dormi igitur *inter medios cleros* (Ps. 67.14), hoc est in medio sortium. Est enim quedam sors gratie honestas uite scolarium, sors ultima est delitiosa iocunditas uite triumphantium, media tranquillitas claustralium. [*Laus beatissime uirginis* 2.16 (Oxford, Magdalen College, 149, fol. 79rb): cited by @hunt:1984schools, p. 9n43]<!--CHECK-->
>
> The life of the cloistered is in between the life of scholars and the life of the triumphant. I slept therefore 'in the middle of lots', that is in the middle of fates. For one fate of grace is the honour of the life of scholars; the final fate is the delicious joy of the life of the triumphant; in the middle is the tranquillity of the cloistered.

There is nothing remarkable about counting oneself among the number of the 'claustralium', which could equally apply to those in other orders. Robert of Cricklade was proud not to refer to himself as a monk: 'Non enim inuideo monachis scribentibus, sed congaudeo, licet non sim monachus, sed indignissimus canonicorum ecclesie sancte dei genitricis Marie' ('I am not jealous of writing monks, but I rejoice with them, although I am not a monk, but the most unworthy of the canons of the church of St Mary, the mother of God') [*De connubio Iacob* 2.22, quoted in @hunt:1936english, p. 31]. Alexander made a point of writing not for a specifically Augustinian or even monastic audience, even heaping praise upon other orders, and continuing to write works specifically designed for the schools, such as *Sacerdos ad altare*, well after his conversion. It is this ability to straddle the worlds of the scholars and the cloistered that Alexander gained from the Augustinians in Oxford.

## Alexander at Cirencester

Alexander's move to St Mary’s Abbey in Cirencester is usually portrayed as a sort of retirement, giving him time away from the jurors, scholars, and prelates to concentrate on writing. It is unlikely that he was any less busy after the move. With perhaps forty canons resident, Cirencester was one of the largest Augustinian foundations in England [@knowles:1948religious, p. 2:259]. The earliest mention of Alexander in the Cirencester cartulary, *c*. 1200–1203, presents him as one of the primary advisors to the abbot [@ross:1964cartulary, pp. 1:295–96 (no. 327); @cheney:1986canterburya, pp. 77–78 (no. 410) explains the dating]. Cirencester appears to have suffered a crisis in its administration late in the twelfth century, which surviving charters only hint at; this required even the involvement of Pope Innocent III [@cheney:1967letters, p. 20 (no. 112)<!--check this is the right reference-->]. The resulting turbulence is not the sort of environment into which one would want to place a new recruit, nor is the position given to him reflective of a notive; indeed, it is possible that Alexander was specifically sent to Cirencester to support the refor

When Alexander later the abbot of Cirencester in 1213, a position he held until his death in 1217 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:159–60, with corrections at 1:278], he became a powerful figure who was also lord of the manor, by royal prerogative [on the early relationship between the abbots and the townspeople, see @rollison:2011commune, chap. 1; @fuller:1884cirencester]. He was the sixth to hold this position since the reconstitution of the abbey by Henry I in 1117 [on the abbey's early history, see @wilkinson:1998cirencester; @evans:1993cirencester]. He seems to have been a reasonably successful administrator, initiating the fall fair for which Cirencester later earned renown [@ross:1964cartulary, <!-- page -->no. 43; @smith:1907itinerary, p. 1:129 (part II, fol. 24: cf. 3:101–102, part VI, fol. 65), refers to a Monday market; quoted in @willis:1718history, p. 1:61]. Yet it was not for this that he went to Cirencester; after travelling to the Fourth Lateran Council, he declared that he was appalled by the curia and terrified by prelates, and simply wanted to be left alone to his books [*Laus sapientie diuine*, 000, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 000; cited in @wedge:1967alexander, p. 000].

Cirencester's books and literary community may have offered a key advantage over Oxford. The house had a rich tradition of making books, now best known for a peculiarly beautiful method of creating decorated initials [@alexander:1978scribes]. One of the most remarkable features of the earlier books from Cirencester is their very detailed colophons, possibly included as a reminder to pray for the souls of those who made the books and their benefactors [@webber:1998libraries, pp. xxv, 26]. If the surviving volumes are representative of the library, there seems to have been a flurry of activity in bookmaking shortly after the establishment of the house, building up a library primarily composed of patristic works, as was common for the Augustinians (a list of works known to have been available is provided below in the appendix). This provided the essential basis for much of Alexander's thought; but he wanted something more.

To his end, Alexander continued to define himself as a teacher, and he probably continued to work for the school at Cirencester, as suggested by the creation of *Corrogationes Promethei* and *Sacerdos ad altare* late in life. In what is probably one of his last works, *Corrogationes noui Promethei*, he sets out a philosophy that places writing as not only the way in which he seeks to form others, but also himself:

> | Et fortassis erit aliquis mea carmina rodens.
> |   Nam quandoque solet serpere liuor humi.
> | Set scribens aliis scribo michi. Disco docendo.
> |   Sic michi sic aliis utilis esse uolo.
> | Proficiens prodesse uolo tibi candide lector.
> |   Discipulusque mei set tibi doctor ero.
> | Qui me commorit melius non tangere clamo.^[Horace, *Sermones* 2.1.45]
> |   Dum michi succenses inuide parce tibi. [*Corrogationes noui Promethei* 331–38, Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42, fol. 70*bis*v (quoted here) and Paris, BnF, lat. 11867, fol. 232vb: @cropp:1991critical, p. 177; linked to @mcdonough:1999alexander, pp. 130, 152, 160, 161; lines 333–34 cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 59]
>
> | And perhaps someone will be gnawing my verses,
> |   for sometimes spite is accustomed to crawl on the ground.
> | But in writing for others I write for myself. I learn by teaching:
> |   thus I wish to be useful both to myself and others.
> | Improving, I wish to be useful to you, pure reader
> |   and my student, but I will be your teacher.
> | Who disturbs me, 'better not touch', I shout:

Teaching is the unifying strain throughout Alexander's career. During his time at Paris, Alexander was probably inspired by figures such as William de Montibus, whom he praises in *Laus diuine sapientie* [@goering:1992william, p. 6–7; @wright:1863alexandri, p. 460], to bring the latest in scholastic theology to bear on practical pastoral matters. To accomplish this, combining his scholastic knowledge from Paris, St Albans, and Oxford – and, most likely, experience in the cloisters of St Frideswide's – he set out on a new project to produce a series of 'meditations'.
