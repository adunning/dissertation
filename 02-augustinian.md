# The Unity of Alexander's Career and His Literary Works

When Alexander Neckam became the abbot of St Mary’s abbey in Cirencester in 1213, a position he held until his death in 1217 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:159–60, with corrections at 1:278], he became the head of an organization that was very much tied up with the cares of the world; a powerful figure who was also lord of the manor, by royal prerogative [on the early relationship between the abbots and the townspeople, see @rollison:2011commune, chap. 1; @fuller:1884cirencester]. He was the sixth to hold this position since the reconstitution of the abbey by Henry I in 1117 [on the abbey's early history, see @wilkinson:1998cirencester; @evans:1993cirencester]. With perhaps forty canons resident, Cirencester was one of the largest Augustinian foundations in England [@knowles:1948religious, p. 2:259]. Alexander was an important administrator, and there is an essential unity between Alexander Neckam's many literary works and his career as a teacher, Augustinian canon, and abbot.

## Augustinians and their books

What did it mean to have an abbot of an Augustinian abbey who also had an active literary career? Among the English Augustinians in the early thirteenth century, there are few examples:

The Rule of St Augustine is maddeningly unspecific, and this is no less the case in its discussion of intellectual persuits. There are only two passages relating to books or reading in the *Ordo Monasterii* after an early discussion of the lessons for the offices:

>| Operentur a mane usque ad sextam,
>| et a sexta usque ad nonam uacent lectioni,
>| et ad nonam reddant codice.

>| Let them work from early morning till noon
>| and take leisure for reading from noon till three,
>| and at three o'clock return the books. [*Ordo Monasterii* 3, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 74–75]

---

>| Sedentes ad mensam taceant, audientes lectionem.

>| When seated at table,
>| they are to be silent and listen to the reading. [*Ordo Monasterii* 7, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 76–77]

The *Praeceptum* is a little more specific, but still has little to say:

>| Et nolite cantare, nisi quod legitis esse cantandum;
>| quod autem non it a scriptum est ut cantetur, non cantetur.

>| Keep to the prescribed text when you sing;
>| avoid texts which are not suited for singing. [*Praeceptum* 2.4, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85]

---

>| Cum acceditis ad mensam, donec inde surgatis,
>| quod uobis secundum consuetudinem legitur,
>| sine tumultu et contentionibus audite.

>| Listen to the customary reading
>| from the beginning to the end of the meal
>| without commotion or arguments. [*Praeceptum* 3.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85]

---

>| Siue autem qui cellario, siue qui uestibus,
>| siue qui codicibus praeponuntur,
>| sine murmure seruiant fratribus suis.
>| Codices certa hora singulis diebus petantur;
>| extra horam qui petierit, non accipiat.

>| Those responsible for food, clothing, or books
>| are to serve their brothers without grumbling.
>| Books are to be requested at a definite hour each day;
>| requests made at other times will be denied. [*Praeceptum* 4.9–10, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 96–97]

Webber and Watson point out an attempt to determine precisely what this means in the *Colloquium magistri et discipuli in regulam beati Augustini de uita clericorum* (or *Bridlington Dialogue*), based on Richard of St Victor's *De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis* [@webber:1998libraries, p. xxi; from @lawson:1960bridlington, p. 162; Richard's text is edited in @colker:1962richard, p. 219]. It appears that the Augustinian canons themselves had little idea what to make of such strictures. Richard and the *Bridlington Dialogue* tend towards liberality in their interpretations.



But it also has this comment:

>| Ut autem uos in hoc libello
>| tamquam in speculo possitis inspicere,
>| ne per obliuionem aliquid neglegatis,
>| semel in septimana uobis legatur.

>| These precepts should be read to you once a week,
>| so that you will see yourselves
>| in this little book as in a mirror
>| and not neglect anything through forgetfulness. [*Praeceptum* 8.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 102–3]

This passage is probably what Alexander Neckam has in mind when he refers to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* as *speculum animi mei*, as we will see later.

## Alexander at Oxford and Robert of Cricklade's influence

After his education at Paris, Alexander began teaching at Dunstable by 1183 [@hunt:1984schools, p. 4], later moving to St Albans, and continuing his teaching at Oxford. Hunt assumed that Alexander came to Oxford to teach, and only became an Augustinian when he moved to Cirencester. He could likely have found better positions at other schools than Oxford in the late twelfth century, and it seems just as likely that he came there specifically to join the Augustinians.

The Augustinians were one of the most exciting orders in Oxford at this time, with more foundations near the schools than any other order, all of them recently established: the priory of St Frideswide's, re-established in 1122; Oseney Abbey, founded 1129 [@postles:1987patronus]; and St George's, absorbed by Oseney *c*. 1149 [@smith:1980lincoln, p. 130 (no. 208); @barron:2002augustinian]. William of Malmesbury writes that Guimund, its first Augustinian prior, transformed St Frideswide's from a small collection of clerics 'qui pro libito uiuerent' ('who were living as they pleased') into a house of regular canons [@winterbottom:2007william, 4.178.4]. While Ralph, the first prior of Oseney, had come from St Frideswide's [@knowles:2001heads, p. 1:179; @postles:1985learning, p. 33], the Augustinians in Oxford did not always cooperate. The cartulary and annals of Oseney Abbey report a dispute with St Frideswide's over the investiture of the church of St Mary Magdalene in 1147–51, 1173–76, and 1200, requiring papal intervention on each occasion; the church had been part of St George's, and the canons of St Frideswide had grounds to question whether this remained the case after its absorption after Roger of Salisbury declared that he had given the church to St Frideswide's [@salter:1929cartulary, pp. 2:214–234 (nos. 780–794); @luard:1864annales, pp. 4:25–27, 4:37–38, 4:50; @cheney:1967letters, p. 45 (no. 276); @barron:2002augustinian, p. 238].<!--...--> The precise role of the Augustinians remains unclear, but after a long tradition of deprecatory scholarship, their role in the early Oxford schools is gradually becoming apparent [@postles:1985learning].

For Alexander Neckam, the opportunity to both take up vows while continuing his teaching must have been irresistible.

> Vita claustralium media est inter uitam scolarium et uitam triumphantium. Dormi igitur *inter medios cleros* (Ps. 67.14), hoc est in medio sortium. Est enim quedam sors gratie honestas uite scolarium, sors ultima est delitiosa iocunditas uite triumphantium, media tranquillitas claustralium. [*Commentary on the Song of Songs* 2.16 (M, fol. 79rb): cited by @hunt:1984schools, p. 9n43]<!--CHECK-->

He had, indeed, long desired to take up monastic vows, as he tells in his commentary on the Song of Songs, and made a pact with a friend who did not follow him:

> Militauimus pariter in castris philosophie et condixeramus nos simul ingressuros fore tabernaculum sapientie. Sed ecce uitis generosa degenerauit in labruscam et philosophus qui aporismatibus arismetice diutius inuigilauerat fisci ratiociniis detinetur. [*CCant.* 8.15 (Oxford, Magdalene College 149, fol. 179vb): quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 9n41]<!--CHECK-->

There <!-- finish -->

He established a relationship with the Augustinian priory of St Frideswide's: the earliest datable record of his time at Oxford is an Ascension Day sermon given between 1191 and 1193 [@salter:1936medieval, p. 37; @southern:1984schools, p. 22<!-- check S: any reason for 1193, or is it a typo?-->], on which it was evidently customary for the people of Oxford to make gifts to the church. He exhorts the people to restore the church, after it burned in a fire of 1190 along with a large part of the town, as reported by the annals of Oseney Abbey [@luard:1864annales, p. 4:43]:

> Doleo uiri fratres quod locus iste ecclesie sancte frideswide. terribilis est modo et horribilis propter ruinam murorum. Quare non cogitatis o laici.
quia ad litteram dictum est. Domine dilexi decorem domus tue. Quare igitur non
diligitis decorem domus domini? ['Sermo in die ascencionis Christi', Oxford, Bodleian Library, Wood empt. 13, fol. 93v): cited in @halsey:198812thcentury, 134; @salter:1936medieval, p. 37; @hunt:1984schools, p. 7]

> I grieve, brothers, that 'this place' [Exod. 3.5] of the church of St Frideswide is terrible now and horrible because of the ruin of its walls. Why do you not consider, you laymen, that it is literally said, 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house' [Ps. 25.8]? Why therefore do you not love the beauty of the house of the Lord?

Alexander uses the phrase 'uiri fratres' constantly when addressing his audience in sermons and his meditative commentaries, a phrase he appears to have borrowed up from the Acts of the Apostles (1.16, 2.29, 2.37, and elsewhere); it occasionally appears elsewhere, as in the letters of Alcuin, but no other medieval author is so fond of it as a catchphrase. The phrase suggests that Alexander himself was an Augustinian by this time.

While the most straightforward reading of Alexander's work hints that he was an Augustinian at Oxford, Hunt argued that he did not become a canon until moving to Cirencester [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 9–12]. This is primarily founded on papal letters: one of Pope Celestine III dated 23 January 1195 names him 'master Alexander of St Albans'; while an epistle from Innocent III of 8 May 1203 names him 'master Alexander of St Albans, canon of Cirencester' [@cheney:1967letters, p. 77 (no. 471); cf. @sayers:1971papal, p. 121; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 11]. This assumes too much consistency on the part of the papal administration; and Hunt was writing before the publication of the Cirencester cartulary [@ross:1964cartulary], which rarely makes distinctions when referring to canons, and always refers to Alexander as 'magister Alexander' or 'Alexander abbas'.

A letter of Peter of Blois to 'master Alexander of St Albans', congratulating him on having taken up monastic vows, is equally ambiguous in its dating of Alexander's joining of the Augustinians. He commends Alexander on having given up the 'honorem magisterii' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)], confirming that Alexander had left a dedicated teaching career to become a canon. Hunt argues that the letter is a later composition, focusing on the reference to Cicero's *De amicitia* [@hunt:1984schools, p. 11], which recalls the late work by Peter with the same name. Peter of Blois began to circulate letter collections around 1184, but this letter occurs in a a later recension. Southern dates the letter to 1197 [as @southern:1984schools, p. 25], though the recension it is now thought to have been compiled between 1198 and 1205 [@cotts:2009clerical, pp. 281-284 summarizes the debate]. This only circumscribes the latest possible date of its composition. Peter's phrase 'litteratura siquidem uestra, et famae commendabilioris celeberrimus odor' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)] only confirms that Alexander began to write early in his career.
<!-- check [@taliadoros:2011communities; @wahlgren:1993letter] -->

While the matter cannot be absolutely resolved, the evidence from Alexander himself is most convincing for an earlier date of joining the Augustinians. If he had indeeed resolved to join a religious order at an early age, it would be strange to wait until he was over forty years of age to act on this. One also wonders whether an inexperienced (if famous) canon would have been immediately appointed to act as one of the primary advisors to the abbot of Cirencester, as he is found *c*. 1200–5 [@ross:1964cartulary, pp. 1:295–96 (no. 327)]. If he was not already an Augustinian when he gave the Ascension Day sermon in the early 1190s, he had aligned himself closely with their approach.

The obvious model for Alexander at Oxford is Robert of Cricklade. Robert became an Augustinian canon at Cirencester (13 km north-west of Cricklade), witnessing a charter between 1136 and 1139 as 'magistro Roberto de Krickel’' [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:337 (no. 372/423)], indicating that he had some formal education. At Cirencester around 1135–40, Robert wrote his *De connubio patriarche Iacob*, and his autograph<!-- correct? check cat--> copy (now Hereford, Cathedral Library, P.iv.8) remained in the abbey library. In the preface, he writes to Lawrence of Westminster, 'dum adhuc scolaris scolarum insisterem regimini' [Oxford, Balliol College, MS 167, fol. 177r: quoted in @burrows:1890collectanea, p. 161<!--something may be wrong here; check other MSS: see Balliol catalogue-->; translated in @leach:1911educational, pp. 102–103]: evidently, he started his career in the schools, in a similar way to Alexander. In the same work, he also praises William of Malmesbury's *Defloratio Gregorii*, *De miraculis beatae uirginis Mariae*, and *Commentary on Lamentations*, which he liked so well that he had copies made for Cirencester [@hunt:1936english, pp. 31–32; @thomson:2003william, p. 74 dates this to March 1137, though the rationale for this is unclear; cf. @winterbottom:2011willelmi, p. 000]. He held Cirencester in enough esteem that he gave his lands in Cricklade to the abbey, 'in qua habitum canonici suscepi', while he was prior of St Frideswide's [@ross:1964cartulary, p. 2:418 (no. 473/729)], a position he gained in 1138 or 1139 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:180, 1:284].<!-- check reference to EEA: 1141? --> This was a time of transition for the Oxford Augustinians: Master Wigod also became prior of Oseney in 1138 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:179]. 'Vir erat antiquus', writes Gerald of Wales in *De principis instructione* [@warner:1891principis, pp. xi, 65], but the date of his death is not known: his last certain occurrence is in 1174 [cited in @knowles:2001heads, p. 1:180; @emden:1957biographical, pp. 1:513–14]. He was presumably dead before 1180, as he is not present in the recounting of the translation of Frideswide on 12 February 1180 written by his successor, Philip, who describes himself as prior [Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Digby 177, fol. 1v<!-- check -->: edited in @blair:1987saint, p. 118].

It is unlikely that Alexander knew Robert in person;

Philip did much to promote the cult of the abbess Frithuswith or St Frideswide [his work is described in @yarrow:2006saints, pp. 177–188], whom the Augutinians presented as a learned figure. In the priory seal from *c.* 1190 [as @blair:2004frithuswith; 'mid to late 1180s' according to @heslop:1988late, pp. 271–272], she holds a set of wax tablets<!--Goering suggests--> or an open book in her left hand, and a fleur-de-lis in her right [reproduced from four Oxford charters in @wigram:1895cartulary, p. 1:ii; composite drawing from London, BL Seal Cast LXX.79 in @heslop:1988late, p. 272; @clark:1889survey, p. 2:159 described this as a 'picture of a doctor with a kind of cope']. This connects her equally with the typical female personifications of the liberal arts and the church, as much as with ecclesiastical administration [@heslop:1988late, p. 271–272]. Frideswide is also shown as a precocious child in two twelfth-century lives [both passages are translated in @blair:1987saint, pp. 74-75]. In 'Life A', from *c.* 1100–30, she learns the Psalter in six months [Life A §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 96: seven months in Oxford, Balliol College, 228; @blair:2004frithuswith, p. 32]; 'Life B', an expanded version dated to *c.* 1140–70 and attributed to Robert of de, Alexander's mentor as the prior of St Frideswide's, reduces this to five months and emphasizes the extent of the improvement this wrought on her character, reflecting the highest medieval ideals for learning [Life B §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 103; on the attribution to Robert, see @blair:1987saint, p. 80]. Indeed, Robert explicitly elevates Frideswide beyond the usual capacities of a woman: 'Stupet Anglia, mirantur uniuersi, infirmum cernentes sexum in etate tenera robur excessisse uirile.' ('England was agog; all marvelled to see the frail sex at so young an age surpassing masculine strength.') [Life B §4: @blair:1987saint, p. 104 (translation from comparison with Life A, 75)].



- is it normal for an order composed of men with a bent for preaching and learning to have so much devotion to female saints? is it Neckam? the Augustinians in Oxford? or the Augustinians in general across Europe?
- is it normal for any order (male or female) associated with learning to have a devotion to female saints?
- does the depiction of F with the wax tablets occur anywhere else?
- why is F associated with learning?

- what other orders are in Oxford? to what extent would he have interacted with them?
- do we know of any other people who might have influenced Neckam who were into woman saints?
- woman saints and flowers?

- are there any other writers based at Oxford apart from A and R?
- are there any other Augustinian writers in England at the time?

- Gloss on the Psalms was likely published from Oxford, as the revisions indicate continuing classroom usage, and most copies of the commentary do not integrate these, meaning there needs to have been time for them to circulate: and Cirencester does not appear to have owned a full copy

## Alexander as a canon at Cirencester

Alexander came to Cirencester at a time when the abbey was undergoing serious reform, which reached even papal attention. The resulting turbulence is not the sort of environment into which one would want to place a new recruit; Alexander was likely sent to Cirencester to support the reform.

- summarize argument: Augustinians liked books, there are evident reasons why A would be attracted to them, and Cirencester was a good fit
- the ethos of the order is an influence, and he is bringing stuff from scholasticism to Cirencester


- so why Cirencester?

A market town where there was no end of work for them.



It is perhaps notable that there are very few glossed biblical texts among these remnants. This was a major feature, for instance, of the library at Oseney Abbey, which is otherwise a similarly conservative collection to that of Cirencester (it owned a volume of Alexander Neckam, but this was an addition of the fifteenth century).

- what books did they have in C?

- St Mary’s in Frankenal: A Cirencester connection? how does the analysis of this place work?

- St Bart's Smithfield? write BL lady Boyle lecture about this

To judge from surviving volumes, Cirencester had a rich tradition of making books, and seems to have developed something of a house style, with a peculiarly beautiful method of creating decorated initials. Almost all the books at Cirencester from before Alexander’s time, however, were copies of patristic works, as were common at Augustinian houses. One can also get some idea of the books Alexander had access to through citations in his writings, though it is not altogether clear whether he consulted them at Cirencester or elsewhere.

Alexander benefited from the patristic reading available to him, but probably wanted something more current and direct. During his time at Paris, Alexander was inspired by the work of authors such as his teacher William de Montibus to bring the latest in scholastic theology to bear on practical pastoral matters. When he came to Cirencester, he was probably shocked to find that he had no such tools to accomplish what he saw as his work there. Alexander’s writings, however, would have represented something quite new to the canons: works that they could use in everyday life.

One of the most remarkable features of the earlier books from Cirencester is their very detailed colophons. @webber:1998libraries have suggested that these were included as a reminder to pray for the souls of those who made the books and their benefactors [pp. xxv, 26].
