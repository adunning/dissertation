  Alexander Neckam (Nequam, Neckham, Necham: 1157–1217) was a teacher and Augustinian canon, and an important administrator at St Mary's Abbey in Cirencester, participating in royal and papal operations and leading it as abbot from 1213 to 1217. He left an enormous body of writings, typically studied according to genre (as grammatical treatises, biblical commentaries, sermons, and poetry), and as works directed to separate scholastic and monastic audiences. They can be shown to form a more coherent whole by considering Alexander's work within the historical context of his career and membership in the Augustinian order. While it has previously been assumed that Alexander only became an Augustinian canon *c.* 1197 at Cirencester, he more likely joined the order in Oxford, where he moved *c.* 1190 and was associated with St Frideswide's Abbey (now Christ Church). His thought and career is patterned after that of Robert of Cricklade, who began as a canon at Cirencester and promoted St Frideswide as a figure of learning. This influence can be traced in Alexander's largest body of writings: the commentaries on the wisdom books, often thought of as encyclopedias but better understood using Alexander's own label of *meditationes*. These sought to put into practice the ideas of meditation promoted by figures such as Hugh of St Victor. Alexander promoted female figures as models for holy living, and sought closer cooperation between religious orders. Together with his sermons, these commentaries were the focus of a campaign to preserve and promulgate Alexander's works, directed by his *socius* Walter de Melida. This provided a means for the canons of Cirencester to pursue closer relationships with their neighbours. *Sol meldunensis*, the miscellany of Alexander's works in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42 is here identified as having been compiled by Geoffrey Brito, who was the personal beneficiary of preserving the former abbot's memory and presented the work to abbot Geoffrey of Malmesbury (1246–60). The book served as a means of exchange between the two houses, continuing a literary relationship dating to the time of Robert of Cricklade and William of Malmesbury, and providing a fitting monument to Alexander's unreserved optimism and desire for enlightenment.

<!-- I argue that he became an Augustinian canon in Oxford rather than at Cirencester, and that his work can most usefully be studied within the context of the needs of these two communities and their relationship with their neighbours. -->
