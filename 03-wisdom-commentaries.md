The crowning works of Alexander's career, and those that most directly reflect his Augustinian mindset, are his commentaries on the Wisdom books: *Expositio super cantica canticorum in laudem gloriose ac perpetue uirginis Marie*; *De naturis rerum*, on Ecclesiastes; the *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis*, projected to treat the entirety of Proverbs but left unfinished; and the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, considering the end of Proverbs. The limited research that has been conducted on these works has assumed them to be purely 'monastic' products, having little relation to his earlier writings, and to be contrasted with his 'scholastic' work. Alexander's commentaries deal with many topics beyond the obvious scope of the biblical texts on which they are based, which has prompted some scholars to label them as encyclopedias, and others to dismiss them as 'the overflow of his personal devotion' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 106]. There is some truth in both of these approaches: the encyclopedic argument is to some extent supported by the adaptation of his materials by Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais later in the thirteenth century [@záhora:2014nature, pp. 230–231]. The commentaries are undeniably designed to prompt fervour, but it does not follow that they should viewed as thoughtless. Neither of these approaches allows one to read the works in the way in which they were intended, or to understand them within the context of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.

When Alexander himself refers to these writings, he calls them *meditationes*, seeking to draw his audience to a higher level of thought in the natural progression of reading presented by Augustinians such as Hugh of St Victor, but rarely put into practice. This classification also draws his *Solatium fidelis anime* and *Meditatio de Magdalena* into the same category. As Hunt first noted, Alexander's interpretative tool of choice in these commentaries is tropology [@hunt:1984schools, p. 97]. Together, these meditations represent the cumulation of Alexander's experience in the schools and the Augustinian order.

## Alexander's biblical commentaries

The division drawn by scholars between Alexander's scholastic and monastic  commentaries on the Bible breaks down immediately once one realizes that his meditations are closest in style to his sermons – also his only works certainly written before he became a canon. While the *Glose super psalterium* and *Corrogationes Promethei* cannot be placed among his meditations, they were both certainly written from an Augustinian cloister. These works are both primarily informational, the former providing an orientation to modern scholarship on the Psalter, and the latter investigating unusual words in the Bible, part of the growing demand for handy reference tools for preachers in all clerical circles [the classic account for this is @rouse:1982statim]. The provenance of surviving copies suggests that they were most popular among the cloistered (though this may be misleading, as survival of all records is most common from this group), while *Corrogationes* also had some secular owners. The meditations of *Solatium*, *Super cantica*, *De naturis rerum*, *Super parabolas*, *De Magdalena*, and *Super mulierem fortem* were specifically designed to meet the pastoral needs of religious communities, and to this extent the 'monastic' label fits, but their contents are highly dependent on Alexander's scholastic experience.

Alexander's approach as a preacher can be described as highly practical, focusing on utility rather than elegance, while emphasizing the responsible use of rhetoric to drive home one's point [quotations in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 84–85]. He seems to have gained some fame as a preacher; copies of his sermons remained in demand after his death (see below, '[Walter's edition of Alexander's sermons]'), and several stories circulated in England and on the continent that depicted him in this role [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 15–16]. While homiletics among the Augustinians in England have been called 'a dead letter' [@dickinson:1950origins, p. 227], Alexander's work shows otherwise, suggesting that the homilies of Robert of Cricklade may have been more than an intellectual exercise. The recent rediscovery of Alexander of Ashby's work has also shown his innovation in preaching and meditation [@donavin:1997sermone; @morenzoni:1991aux; @morenzoni:2004alexandri]. It is his preaching style as a secular and canon and focus on the care of souls that inform Alexander's meditative commentaries, and this is what distinguishes them from his teaching materials.

### *Glose super psalterium*

Alexander's first formal biblical commentary, *Super psalterium*, is also his first work unquestionably written as an Augustinian. In this, he drew not on his experience as a preacher, but as a lecturer, following a style most similar to his commentaries on Martianus Capella and the Athanasian Creed. He takes a traditional approach to biblical interpretation in a classroom setting, concentrating on outlining the authorities for the interpretation of a given passage, especially the ubiquitous *Glosa* [the only analysis of this work is @hunt:1984schools, pp. 97–103]. He weighs between these authorities, and uses them to drive home key theological lessons.

In its earliest manuscript, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, the *Glose super psalterium* are contained in a separate 'booklet' from the rest of the volume, and once a separate manuscript that was later bound with other materials [see @gillespie:2011medieval: the structure is discussed below in chapter 5, under '[Oxford, Jesus College, 94]']. It appears to be a product of Oxford rather than Cirencester, and is extensively annotated in several versions of Alexander's own hand, most likely representing his revisions to the lectures as he repeated them. It was also, however, designed for dissemination, including a formal *accessus* that sets out the four senses in which he will expound the text (history, allegory, tropology, anagoge). His work on this book is solid; in some surviving manuscripts, it is presented in a way similar to manuscripts of the *Glosa* itself, with the full text of the Psalms given in a centre column, and the commentary surrounding it, facilitating its use in the classroom. This layout was also applied to many copies of Peter Lombard's commentary on the Psalms. Alexander's glosses function as an admirable update to the other commentaries available in his day, presenting the cutting edge of scholarship in the late twelfth century, and at least eleven copies are known to have existed; but there is nothing particularly innovative about its approach. Records of lectures on the Psalms were common, and there was no obvious need that Alexander's work filled in contrast to his peers. He did not directly publish the lectures that he indicates he gave on Ezekiel, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs [@hunt:1984schools, p. 8].

### *Corrogationes Promethei*

Closest in style to the *Glose super psalterium* is *Corrogationes Promethei*, which also became Alexander's most widely copied work. A reference to his teaching 'in the schools' in the past tense probably indicates that it was written at Cirencester [@hunt:1984schools, p. 25], but the time of its composition is otherwise unknown, and it may have followed one or more of the wisdom commentaries. It is divided into two parts, the first summarizing key grammatical principles (largely based on Priscian) and the second working through the entire Bible, providing explanations of its most obscure words and notes on their spelling. The later metrical version of the work takes a similarly utilitarian approach [brief excerpts printed by @hunt:1991teaching, pp. 1:247–250], and seems to have been conceived, in a typical medieval mode, as verses for memorizing the words it presents [for other examples of this trend, see @dunning:2016samuel; @dinkovabruun:2010verse].

There has been confusion about the meaning of the title *Corrogationes Promethei* since Alexander's own time [the problem is examined in detail by @cropp:1991critical, pp. 52–71]. A letter survives with a thirteenth-century copy of the work glossing the title as 'collections of a wise or prudent man' ['Congregationes sapientis siue prudentis': Évreux, Bibliothèque municipale, L. 72, fol. 1v: printed by @omont:1887catalogue, p. 65; @meyer:1896notice, pp. 651–652; @guéry:1917histoire, pp. 393–394]. Meyer felt that the title implied a complaint, preferring to translate the title as 'Travaux d'un homme condamné à l'oisiveté' [@meyer:1896notice, p. 653]. In support of this view, he cites a preface by the younger Peter of Blois, a canon of Chartres, comparing himself to the suffering and banished Prometheus, 'separated from the scholastic delights' [@reimarus:1837petri, p. 1: 'a scolasticis semotus deliciis']. Alexander does not appear to think of himself as exiled to Cirencester, separated from the scholars of Paris and Oxford. Hunt notes that Prometheus is presented as a teacher when the work is mentioned in *De naturis rerum*; he glosses the title as 'collections of an instructor in the rudiments' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 36]. Wedge, in an attempt to reconcile the three views, amplifies it further: 'collections of a scholar who has only his leisure hours to devote to the study of the Scripture, being at other times weighed down by more worldly duties' [@wedge:1967alexander, p. 77].<!-- check ref: PIMS --> Cropp further points out a Servian interpretation of Prometheus as found in the Third Vatican Mythographer, in which he is presented as a self-sacrificing scholar and instructor [@cropp:1991critical, pp. 69–71]. Most convincing is the note, in the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources*, of a reference to *Rhetorica ad Herennium* 4.9 that compares Prometheus to a 'ridiculous master' [@latham:1975dictionary, s.v. 'corrogatio']. Alexander might have seen this in Priscian's quotation of the passage [Priscian, *Ars grammatica* 3.34, @hertz:1855prisciani, 2:108, lines 10–11]. This makes the title a self-deprecating and slightly humorous one.

The relationship of *Corrogationes Promethei* to Alexander's other biblical work is somewhat difficult to determine. Parts of it were apparently based on his lecture notes, as there are many similarities in approach with *Super psalterium*. He occasionally refers to the opinion of his own unnamed master [@hunt:1984schools, p. 6n30]. At first glance, the text would appear to offer a glimpse at Alexander's pure analytical side, but this impression is complicated by *Sol meldunensis* (Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42), which presents several excerpts from *Corrogationes Promethei* (and its citations tend to be accurate) suggesting that there were several sections of the work contributing levity similar to the *exemplaria* of his sermons, notably a story of a deacon punished for celebrating a Mass (fols 92r–92v, an added leaf). A critical edition is necessary to understand the context of these quotations. There are also several passages from a prosimetrical version of *Corrogationes noui Promethei*, not known to survive, but mentioned in the library catalogue of the Augustinian canons at Barnwell [@webber:1998libraries, A2.†3]. In the context of the early thirteenth century, the most obvious link between *Corrogationes Promethei* and Alexander's other works remains that of preaching, which has been shown to have driven much of the demand for similar reference works [@rouse:1982statim].

### *Solatium fidelis anime*

In Alexander's following works, he returned to his strength in preaching; these commentaries are still visibly supported by his reading of the authorities, but he quotes them with much less frequency, without the intent of teaching how to navigate them. This produces a much more original format: a treatise that happens to follow the framework of a biblical text. His next work after *Super psalterium* is a commentary on Genesis 1:10–2:3. There is nothing explicitly indicating whether it was a product of Oxford or Cirencester. In the sole surviving manuscript, which once belonged to St Augustine's, Canterbury and is now in that cathedral library, it is given the heading 'Tractatus moralium super Genesim qui dicitur Solatium fidelis anime'. The work never seems to been widely disseminated, although Alexander refers to it in *De naturis rerum* [*De naturis rerum* 2.1, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 127]; there are no records of copies having existed elsewhere. This lends weight to a general sense that the work was somewhat experimental.

*Solatium* is also the first of Alexander's commentaries that can be labelled as one of his 'meditations', though the concept has not yet been fully developed. In contrast to the approach of his glosses on the Psalms that seek to provide a varied approach to the text, Alexander declares that the specific aim of *Solatium* is to provide spiritual refreshment – 'And so, saving anagoge for other treatises, in this work I will give particular attention to tropology.'[^disputent] The mechanics of this have been laid out by Tomáš Záhora [@záhora:2014nature, pp. 65–72; @záhora:2011tropology]. Each of the seven days of creation is linked first to an action available to the soul that allows it to be infused with grace, and second to seven corresponding gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2–3). The pattern is similar to many medieval accounts of the virtues, notably Hugh of St Victor's *De quinque septenis*, which portrays each of the gifts of the Holy Spirit as being given in response to seven petitions in the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) [edited and translated in @dunning:2016hugh; for a comparison of Hugh's categories with Augustine, Paschasius Radbertus, and Gregory the Great, see @rehm:1994bebilderte, pp. 7–14]. Closely linked to tropology in *Solatium* is the idea of meditation, portrayed in the terms of the Victorines: it is a consideration of created things, gradually bringing a person to a state fit for contemplation [*Solatium*, fols 19va and 14ra, quoted in @záhora:2011tropology, p. 119n27]. Alexander's meditations are an attempt to undertake this practice – in other words, his endeavour to show his readers what other Augustinians had already established as the direct route to salvation.

[^disputent]: *Solatium*, prologue, Canterbury, Cathedral Library, Lit. B. 6 (4), fol. 1ra:

    > Disputent alii de apicibus uiris celestis. ego quidem habeo felices ad uota successus⸵ si michi detur a domino pauperes cristi melle trophologice dulcedinis reficere spiritualiter. Anagogen itaque tractatibus aliis reseruans⸵ specialem in hoc opere tropologie daturus sum operam.

    Quoted in part in @hunt:1984schools [p. 97]; @záhora:2014nature [pp. 68–69]; @záhora:2011tropology [p. 119].

### *Expositio super cantica canticorum in laudem gloriose ac perpetue uirginis Marie*

Alexander's commentary on the Song of Songs is a natural progression from *Solatium*. His proem describes the virtues of humility and obedience, continuing through Genesis with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other figures of the Old Testament. These are all portrayed as forerunners of the Virgin Mary, herself the ideal model for human emulation. The first chapters of Book 1 begin not with the opening of the Song of Songs, but once again with Genesis. If Alexander can be taken at his word, the work was conceived from the outset as the first of a series of commentaries on the Wisdom books. He explains later in *Super parabolas* that the order of the books' interpretation differs from that of their appearance ('just as the order of the edition of the books of Aristotle'): the Song of Songs is logically the first book in terms of exposition, as it addresses the 'mystery of the Incarnation'; Ecclesiastes relates to the 'time of apostolic preaching'; and Proverbs to the 'time of the rise of heretics'.[^order]

[^order]: *Super parabolas* Proem.6, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 59rb:

    <div lang="la">
    > Hec in medium protulimus⸵ tropologie deseruientes. Si enim allegorie stilus obsequatur⸵ uidebitur intelligenti liber canticorum primus esse in ordine trium operum salomonis. sicut ordo editionis librorum aristotilis⸵ contrarius est ordini expositionis eorundem. Liber igitur canticorum⸵ ad misterium incarnationis. ecclesiastes⸵ ad tempus predicationis apostolice. liber parabolarum⸵ ad tempora heresum subortarum refertur. Hinc est quod in hoc opere quod premanibus habemus⸵ nomine meretricis˷ tipice designatur hereticorum peruersa doctrina. Quoniam uero per gloriosam uirginem cuncte hereses erant interimende⸵ transfert se in spiritu in hoc opere salomon quandoque ad misterium incarnationis.
    </div>

Like *Solatium*, *Super cantica* is founded on a tropological understanding of its text, though it takes a more balanced approach, while further putting the idea of meditation into practice. Specific chapters are labelled 'tropological expositions' (e.g. 2.9, 2.15) or allegories (e.g. 2.10), but Alexander mostly focuses on a mystical understanding of a literal reading of the text (as he explains in 1.2, 'De mistico intellectu et sensu litterali'). Rachel Fulton Brown has shown that Alexander draws not on the traditional allegorical tradition of interpreting the Song of Songs, which understands it as a dialogue between the church and Christ, but on a frame that originated in Carolingian liturgies, taking the text as a literal dialogue between the Virgin Mary and Christ as a child [@fulton:1996mimetic, p. 90]. This occasionally produces interpretations that might today raise eyebrows: 'Each is the spouse of Christ – the mother of Christ, the daughter of Christ. Each is the spouse of Christ through an unbreakable chain of privileged love. What is written, "They shall be two in one flesh", can be understood as referring both to Christ and the church, and to Christ and the blessed virgin.' [*Super cantica* 1.6 (Oxford, Magdalen College, fol. 6va): 'Vtraque sponsa cristi est⸵ mater cristi. filia cristi. Vtraque sponsa cristi est⸵ per amoris priuilegiati uinculum indissolubile. Quod autem scriptum est *erunt duo in carne una* [Gen. 2:24]. referri potest nunc ad cristum et ecclesiam⸵ nunc ad cristum et beatam uirginem.' The full chapter is quoted in @riedlinger:1958makellosigkeit, p. 330, though inaccurately, from Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodley 356, fol. 9ra.] In Alexander's case, a basis in the literal sense of the text is only logical, if meditation is to focus on understanding the created in order to attain contemplation of the divine.

It is also in *Super cantica* that Alexander develops what he later calls 'consolatory meditations'. He cites Augustine, Gregory, and Anselm of Canterbury as influencing his approach.[^AugGreg] These typically focus on visualizing the subject he describes in detail. It is difficult for modern readers to relate to these passages due to their length and rhetoric, and Hunt characterizes them as essentially meaningless devotional writing [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 97, 106–107]. It seems this was a criticism Alexander faced even in his own day, and he later explains in *Super parabolas* that this is a deliberate choice:

[^AugGreg]: *Super cantica* 6.13 (Oxford, Magdalen College 149, fol. 173vb), also quoted in part in @hunt:1984schools [p. 107n55]:

    > Hec si pie lector dulciter obseruaueris erit guttur tuum quasi optimum quia meditationes interne deuotionis condite dulcedine⸵ saporis erunt delitiosi. Frigidum pectus quod amoris sancti calore ignitur frigida dat uerba et frigidas uoluit meditationes. Cor estu flammigere caritatis accensum ex se sermones emittit ignitos. Cum ignea loquitur deuotio⸵ fiunt labia cordis sicut uit⟨t⟩a coccinea. Augustini lege meditationes fructuosas in scriptum redactas⸵ et uulnerabitur cor tuum telo spiritualis amoris. Sagitte potentis acute uulnerant et penetrant usque ad interiora. et ex fonte cordis. sanguinem quendam eliciunt deuotionis. Dulcissimas inspice gregorii meditationes⍪ et palato cordis tui dulce sapiet manna dulcedinis eloquentie suauissime. Relege iocundissimas anselmi cantuariensis meditationes in quibus tam flores quam fructus suauitatis legere poteris uelut in orto quodam deliciarum constitutus. Audiens amor uerba dilecti consolantis dilectam partes suas interponit⍪ uidens uerecundiam simplicem anime penitenti taciturnitatem inposuisse⸵ dum eximie maiestatis dulcedinem admiratur.

> I have primarily aimed to devote myself to tropology, so that passages of allegory may be saved for a particular case. And let not a casual observer accuse me of long-windedness; for it is pleasing not to take the duty of an expositor, but to revive the souls of a cloister with consolatory meditations, sometimes shaken by wrongful troubles, and sometimes wounded by its own arrows.[^tropologie]

[^tropologie]: *Super parabolas* Proem.6, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 59rb–va, also quoted in @hunt:1984schools [p. 97]:

    <div lang="la">
    > Principaliter uero tropologie indulgere proposui. ita ut allegorie loca quedam specialiter reseruentur. Nec me prolixitatis arguat temerarius arbiter. neque enim expositoris officium tantum⸝ assumere libet⸵ set etiam consolatoriis meditationibus [59va] recreare claustralium animos⸝ non nunquam iniustis uexatos molestiis. non nunquam propriis sautiatos iaculis.
    </div>

\noindent Given the intentionally slow pace at which the commentaries unfold, it should be no surprise that readers who have approached Alexander's commentaries looking for something else have come away disappointed, but that does not meant that they were any less innovative. It has already been noted that Alexander took pains to work with speakers of Hebrew to improve his exegesis [@loewe:1958alexander; @hunt:1984schools, pp. 108–110]. There is great potential for reading them in the wrong way if one is unaware of their explicit function as a tool for pastoral care.

### *De naturis rerum et super ecclesiasten*

What is today Alexander's most famous work, *De naturis rerum*, is most commonly described as an 'encyclopedia', but within the context of his other biblical commentaries these qualities are seen to be the result of his exegetical program. It is unclear who first popularized this approach: it is mentioned in a 1960 letter of Beryl Smalley (quoted above under '[Alexander's reception in modern scholarship]'), and appears on many occasions in later scholarship [@michaudquantin:1966petites; @talaveraesteso:1983historia; @fumagalli:1985due; @berlioz:1994recueils; @ribémont:1995natura; @voorbij:2000purpose; @schuler:2000fabrica; @schuler:2002rives; @ribémont:2002renaissance; @tilliette:2005rhétorique; @keen:2013shifting; @haye:1997lateinische, p. 47 also calls *Laus diuine sapientie* a 'Naturenzyklopädie']. These works only engage with the first two books published by Wright, and their interpretation stem directly from his truncation of the work, which he stated 'was intended to be a manual of the scientific knowledge of the time' [@wright:1863alexandri, p. xiv]. His knowledge of the remainder of the work is reflected in his description of it as a commentary on Ecclesiasticus rather than Ecclesiastes [@wright:1863alexandri, pp. xiv, lxvii]. The most successful treatment of *De naturis rerum* as an encyclopedia is that of @záhora:2007tropological [published with corrections, @záhora:2014nature], pursuing Hunt's observation that in the context of the Ecclesiastes commentary, the true focus of the whole of *De naturis rerum* is tropology. Unfortunately, he pays limited attention to Alexander's other commentaries, and insists on referring to both *De naturis rerum* and *Laus sapientie diuine* as encyclopedias to designate their primary focus. While he mentions some other descriptions of tropology in Alexander's commentaries, he does not address the obvious paring of those on Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs, or provide any criteria showing why certain of these works are described as encyclopedias, and others are not. Understanding *De naturis rerum* as an encyclopedia may help to provide context for some of the works following it to which the label has been retroactively applied, but it tells us little about how Alexander conceived of his work.

Alexander leaves no doubt that the three Wisdom books are to be taken as a series, providing a passage explaining their relationship in terms of stages towards contemplation of the divine: Proverbs inviting a person to disregard for oneself, Ecclesiastes for the world, and the Song of Songs to complete joy.[^primo] He maintains this focus throughout the commentary in a style that directly parallels *Super cantica*, providing several more of his 'consolatory meditations'. The relationship between these works is most fully articulated in *Super parabolas*.

[^primo]: *De naturis rerum* 3.1.1, Oxford, Magdalen College, 139, fol. 73v:

    <div lang="la">
    > In primo opere salomonis⸵ inuitatur homo ad contemptum sui. in secundo⸵ ad contemptum mundi. in tercio⸵ ad deliciosam dulcedinem iocunditatis interne contemplationis. Vnde cum idida idest dilectus dictus sit⸵ dictus est et ecclesiastes˷ idest concionator. dictus est et salomon⸵ idest pacificus. Cum enim animus humanus fragilitatem humane conditionis in libro experientie assidue legat⸵ docet hominem⸵ se ipsum paruipendere et contempnere. Incipere namque debet homo a se ipso˷ ut se miserum esse et infinitis uanitatibus obnoxium⸵ addiscat. deinde [73vb] mundana. caduca et transitoria et friula esse sentiat. demum quadam felici mentis extasi⸵ in amorem conditoris sui rapiatur.
    </div>

### *Meditatio de Magdalena*

It becomes increasingly difficult to establish a chronology for Alexander's meditations with his later works. His *Meditatio de Magdalena* is also called *Tractatus super admirabili conuersione beatissime Magdalenes* in *Sol meldunensis* (Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42). It only refers to *Super cantica*,^[Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 140ra: 'De cursu autem petri et iohannis⸵ dilucide licet breuiter nos expediuimus in laudibus uirginis matris.'] and may even have been written before *De naturis rerum*. Alexander's devotion to Mary Magdalene might have been inspired through the church dedicated to this saint near St Frideswide's in Oxford, administered by the Augustinians. Its edition correctly associates the work with Alexander's wisdom commentaries, while omitting *Solatium* [@bestul:1999meditation, p. 1], but the imposition of a new paragraph structure on the work obscures its organizational similarities with the other meditations, causing it to appear as a rather amorphous creation. Following the structure of the text provided in the manuscript, *De Magdalena* emerges as a commentary on the Song of Songs, with divergences into the Gospels. Each of these texts is quoted at the beginning of a new paragraph, as in Alexander's other meditative commentaries:

1. Song of Songs 1:1, beginning *Osculetur me osculo oris sui.*
2. Luke 7:38–43, *Et osculabatur pedes eius et unguento unguebat.*
3. Luke 10:42, *Porro unum est necessarium. Maria optimam partem elegit quae non auferetur ab ea.*
4. Song of Songs 1:9–10, *Pulchre sunt gene tue sicut turturis.*
5. Song of Songs 2:2, *Sicut lilium inter spinas⸵ sic amica mea inter filias.*
6. Song of Songs 4:1–12, *Quam pulchra es amica mea, quam pulcra.*
7. John 20:1, *Vna autem sabbati, Maria Magdalene uenit mane, cum adhuc tenebre essent, ad monumentum.* (with reference to Mark 16:9 and Matthew 28:9–10; closing with Song of Songs 4:8)

\noindent This neatly encapsulates the Gospel passages typically associated with Mary Magdalene in the Middle Ages, using these as another literal interpretation of the Song of Songs: 'Let us listen to the historical words of the evangelist, faithfully expounding the text of Solomon.'^[*De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 140ra: 'Audiamus uerba euangelice historie⸵ textum salomonis fideliter exponentia.'] Mary Magdalene is also associated with other biblical women such as Rebecca and Sara, all put forward as ideal models for anyone who wishes to 'manfully support a burden and perturbation day and night'[^uiriliter] through meditation and humility, and thereby able to reach the heights of contemplation.[^ignoras]

[^uiriliter]: *De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 136rb: 'Milites egregii⸵ sunt milites cristi. qui uiriliter sustinent pondus et estum dierum et noctium.'

[^ignoras]: *De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 136va:

    <div lang="la">
    > Vel cum dicitur. *si ignoras te o pulcherrima inter mulieres*⸵ [Song 1:7] aposiopesis est. Ac si dicatur. Mirum est si anima deliciis contemplationis uacans⸵ felicitatem status sui ignorat.

    </div>

### *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*

Just as *Super cantica* is an expansion of *Solatium fidelis anime*, Alexander's *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* even more directly extends his *Meditatio de Magdalena*. It runs through the entire 'strong woman' text of Proverbs 31:10–31 three times, dealing in turn with Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, and the Church. The first book includes many borrowings from *De Magdalena*, though it was not conceived as a revision of this work, referring to it separately.^[Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 79ra: 'Beata autem magdalena cuius laudibus iterato deseruire stilus noster gloriatur'.] As with *De Magdalena*, there is no specific evidence that the work was written after *De naturis rerum*. Hunt placed its writing during Alexander's abbacy on the basis that 'he assumes the tone of a superior giving instruction' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 28], but this can be disproven through a cross reference to it early in *Speculum speculationum*, whose title confirms that it was begun while Alexander was still a canon [*Speculum speculationum* 1.2.10, London, British Library, Royal 5 F. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>, fol. 5va, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 23]. A reference in *Super mulierem* to *Super cantica* refers to this work as finished, perhaps recently.^[Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 99vb: 'Dulcissima est historialis intelligentie ueritas. quam expositione luculenta declarauimus in opere nostro⸵ quod in laudes gloriose dei genitricis feliciter consummauimus.'] The evidence of a manuscript of the work with Alexander's autograph corrections, [Oxford, Jesus College, 94] (discussed in more detail below) and the structure of the text suggest that second two books were a later addition. It gives the impression of having been written on a piecemeal basis to gradually extend his meditations, perhaps as he delivered them in chapter.

*Super mulierem fortem* does not diverge from the exegetical methods set by Alexander's other wisdom commentaries: tropology remains the focus,[^ordeum] and meditation itself continues to be shown as the surest route to kindling love for the divine within oneself.[^supremo] The first two books read almost as a catalogue of women from the Old Testament, with the last book showing that the *Mulierem fortem* passage applies to all that is holy. The two Marys are strong in their virtues, while the Church is strong through every type of its members – the married, widows, virgins, confessors, martyrs, and those leaving both active and contemplative lives.[^lives] While the text itself seems to be designed for cloistered communities, the universal view Alexander takes suggests that he was concerned to help his audience to understand their place within the broadest context possible.

### *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis*

Alexander's commentary on Proverbs is unfinished, covering only 1:1 through 3:27. He was presumably still working on it at his death, with the text gradually breaking down into quotations of Bede towards its end – possibly given its final form by his fellow canon Walter de Melida, as suggested below in the discussion of the manuscript, [Oxford, Jesus College, 94]. He might have had a disadvantage in writing on Proverbs in comparison to *Super cantica* and *De naturis rerum*, since he had already lectured on the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes [*Solatium* 22, fol. 26va, and *Super cantica* 6.24, cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 8]. In spite of its unpolished state, Alexander's reputation was such that at least two other communities acquired copies.

As it stands, the book provides Alexander's fullest explanation of his program of meditation, closely linked to his articulation for the relationship between Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs:

> The book of Proverbs owes itself to ebbing consideration, by which someone turns towards the state of his condition; Ecclesiastes is answerable to the consideration of the worldly vanities; the book of Canticles indulges divine contemplation. Idida[^idida] shouts that 'the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.' Ecclesiastes preaches, saying, 'Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.' Solomon sighs for the delights of peace, saying, 'Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.' Idida, that is 'you will be beloved by the Lord through humility', which teaches a person to scorn himself and to take prudent fear. Prudence and hope and temperance confer to you the name of a preacher. Prudence, truly investigating the natures of transitory things, understands them to be subject to vanities. Hope, now holding God himself with the hand of desire, declares that everything apart from God is subject to manifold vanity. Temperance, pondering that what is adequate by nature is restrained,<!--?--> knows that the love of temporal things is to be driven out. Holy love and devotion delight to be loved with a kiss and embraces.
>
> The three works of three-named Solomon are complying, therefore, in threefold consideration: to enter, to depart, to surpass. To enter the chamber of the heart, to enter the dug earth, and to know your situation. The dug earth is the land of free will, which, if it is tilled well by the discipline of a farmer, will produce glad crops of virtues. Therefore, a person should meet himself with the doors of the spirit closed, lest wandering thoughts come near secret tracks, disturbers of inner stilness; he should consult the conscience as to whether, with his path directed through the ways of salvation, he is aimed towards the appropriate goal. Afterwards, to depart from your land with Abraham, that is from the land of free will, and from your family, now untroubled by the disturbances of the mind – to depart, I say, by the steps of contemplation, to perceiving the vanities of things and their advantages. What are the vanities of the world to us, born to greater things?<!--?--> Considering the usefulness of things carries us so much away into the admiration of divine power as its wisdom and kindness. Finally, surpass the worldly machine, and direct the sharpness of the mind so that you may drink from the light of immeasurable glory, and indulge in purified meditations; and with the likenesses of things banished far off, devotion, leading the way, may prepare a journey in pure simplicity of understanding.[^J58va]

    </div>

\noindent This scheme is a practical application of Origen's framing of the Wisdom books in his commentary on the Song of Songs, a copy of which Cirencester is known to have possessed [@mynors:1991registrum, 10.5]. Origen refers Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs to three branches of knowledge: moral, natural, and contemplative (*ethicam*, *physicam*, *epopticen*; or *moralem*, *naturalem*, *inspectiuam*) [Origen, trans. Rufinus, *Commentarium in Canticum canticorum*, Prol.: see @martens:2012origen, p. 79]. It is this opportunity to express his idea of the relationship between the books that seems to have captured Alexander's attention and creativity in writing the Proverbs commentary. He is concerned at the beginning of the work with the falseness of earthly glory, as he reflects on the inevitable fall of both classical emperors and modern monarchs, appropriate to the final years of the reign of King John. He recognizes that some readers find him too prolix,[^iuniores] and though he promises the 'consolatory meditations' of his earlier commentaries, they never appear. Alexander was exhausted by Rome after travelling to the Fourth Lateran Council, writing that he never wished to see the curia again [*Laus sapientie diuine* 5.325–344, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 448; translated in @wedge:1967alexander, p. 20–21]. The incomplete state of both *Super parabolas* and *Speculum speculationum* can likely be attributed to his responsibilities as an abbot.

## Meditation and the Augustinians

This survey of Alexander's biblical scholarship shows that, after the traditional approach of *Super psalterium*, he combined his preaching experience with scholastic knowledge to produce commentaries that would address specific areas not already adequately covered by modern writers. *Corrogationes Promethei* was probably a tool designed specifically for preachers, while his other works applied tropology to the matter of caring for cloistered communities.

This idea of meditation was inspired directly by Augustinian writers. The idea of *meditatio* leading to *contemplatio* is hinted at by Gregory the Great, whose homilies on Ezechiel Alexander would likely have known from lecturing on the book.^[Gregory the Great, *Homilies in Ezechiel* 2.1.17, @adriaen:1971sancti, 223, lines 554–60: 'Hinc est etiam quod helias, cum uocem domini se cum loquentis audiret, in speluncae suae ostio stetisse describitur et faciem uelasse, quia cum per contemplationis gratiam uox supernae intellegentiae sit in mente, totus homo iam intra speluncam non est, quia animum carnis cura non possidet, sed stat in ostio, quia mortalitatis angustias exire meditatur.'] Alexander cites the influence of Anselm of Canterbury, who portrays meditation as the awakening of the mind to its salvation, but does not clearly articulate this process. [Anselm of Canterbury, *Orationes siue meditationes*, meditatio 3, @schmitt:1938anselmi, p. 3:84, lines 3–7: 'Anima Christiana, anima de graui morte resuscitata, anima de misera seruitute sanguine dei redempta et liberata: excita mentem tuam, memento resuscitationis tuae, recogita redemptionem et liberationem tuam. Retracta ubi et quae sit uirtus tuae saluationis, uersare in meditatione eius, delectare in contemplatione eius.'] Alexander also likely had access to Bernard of Clairvaux's *Sermons on the Song of Songs* at Cirencester [@mynors:1991registrum, 34.21], who only shallowly discusses the idea of meditation in reaction to a quotation from the Psalms, 'my heart became hot within me, and in my meditation a fire will burn',^[Psalm 38:4: 'Concaluit cor meum intra me et in meditatione mea exardescet ignis'.] though he once refers to 'our meditations'. [Bernard of Clairvaux, *Sermones super Cantica Canticorum* 32.4, @leclercq:1957sermones, p. 1:228: 'Sunt enim quaedam uerba Verbi sponsi ad nos, nostrae meditationes de ipso et eius gloria, elegantia, potentia, maiestate.']

Alexander's understanding of meditation is most directly paralleled in Hugh of St Victor, whose *De archa Noe* was in the Cirencester library [@mynors:1991registrum, 97.4]. He presents tropology as the key tool for understanding the ark in terms of gradually heightening moral virtues [Hugh of St Victor, *De archa Noe* 4.9, @sicard:2001hugonis, p. 113, lines 72–73 'Tropologia altitudinem arche metitur, quia in profectu uirtutum crecit dignitas meritorum.']. Exegesis allows the ark to be divided into three houses, representing the shadow, body, and spirit, to which further explanations are applied, cumulating in the works of people, the works of angels, and the works of God; faith, hope, and charity (morally); or right thinking, meditation, and contemplation [@sicard:2001hugonis, p. 115, lines 103–112: 'In prima ergo mansione collocamus opera hominum, in secunda mansione opera angelorum, in tertia mansione opera Dei. Vel moraliter: prima mansio est fides, secunda mansio est spes, tertia mansio est caritas. Vel secundum anagogem: prima mansio est cogitatio recta, secunda mansio est meditatio prouida, tertia mansio est contemplatio clara'; cf. *Libellus de formatione arche* 4, @sicard:2001hugonis, p. 141]. This ascent is agreed to be one of the most important features of Hugh's approach, and in particular one of the keys to his success in the creation of mental imagery [@rudolph:2014mystic, p. 352; @carruthers:1998craft, pp. 243–246]. Hugh's model for combining intellectual rigour with meditation was quickly accepted within the Augustinian order; this can be seen, for example, in the letters of Hugh Metel [@mews:2001hugh, p. 72], and it is precisely what Alexander puts into practice in his meditative commentaries.

Hugh puts forward meditation not only as a method of ascending in spiritual health and maturity, but also as the logical progression in gaining knowledge and aptitude, as he describes in his *Didascalicon*. 'The beginning of learning is in reading; its consummation in meditation; which, if anyone learns to love it more intimately and desires to be engaged more often in it, brings life to a very pleasant condition, and offers the greatest consolation in distress.' [Hugh of St Victor, *Didascalicon* 3.10: @buttimer:1939hugonis, p. 59, lines 20–23: <span lang="la">'Principium ergo doctrine est in lectione, consummatio in meditatione, quam si quis familiarius amare didicerit ei que sepius uacare uoluerit, iucundam ualde reddit uitam, et maximam in tribulatione prestat consolationem.'</span>] Meditation accomplishes this because it is not only a step towards learning, but also one of four steps towards the perfection of oneself: reading, meditation, prayer, and activity, all of which finally lead to contemplation of the divine. [@buttimer:1939hugonis, pp. 109, lines 13–17: <span lang="la">'Quattuor sunt in quibus nunc exercetur uita iustorum et, quasi per quosdam gradus ad futuram perfectionem subleuatur, uidelicet lectio siue doctrina, meditatio, oratio, et operatio. Quinta deinde sequitur, contemplatio, in qua, quasi quodam precedentium fructu, in hac uita etiam que sit boni operis merces futura pregustatur.'</span>] One can see why this would be so attractive to someone seeking to advance the health of a religious community. This approach to meditation as a unified method of achieving both moral and intellectual progress is precisely what Alexander promotes: 'It is fitting for us to indulge in meditations of this sort, by which the world must be crucified with its vices and desires. These meditations also produce new studies, by which the soul is happily restored.'[^meditationibus]

[^meditationibus]: *Super mulierem fortem*, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 109rb: <span lang="la">'Huiuscemodi meditationibus indulgere nos decet˷ quibus mundus crucifigi debet cum uiciis et concupiscentiis. Pariunt et he meditationes⸵ studia nouella. quibus animus feliciter recreatur.'</span>

While Hugh provides the theories supporting this scholastic idea of meditation, he is vague on the specifics of how it is to be practised, and this is the void that Alexander seeks to fill with his commentaries. His fullest articulation of the theory opens *Super parabolas*:

> Human meditation at one moment is turned upon man himself; at another it passes to the other created things. When indeed it is turned back upon man himself, scrutiny is either directed at those things that look to the dignity of a noble creature, or to those which point towards the fragility of the human condition. When, however, reason, just as if it were sitting in a watchtower, discerns the changes of transitory things, it sometimes discovers their vanity, and often their usefulness. But while it ventures towards that immeasurable light, devotion rejoices all the more to fix the sharpness of the mind. For the eye of love gladly returns to the Beloved: sometimes it sees the humility of a humanity sweetly assumed, sometime it reverently regards the height of divine majesty. Therefore reason, entering the inner chamber of the heart and concentrating its thoughts inwards, considers the dignity and fragility of human nature; crossing to the show of the worldly theatre, it recognizes the vanity and usefulness of things; raising itself above itself, it considers the humanity and divinity of the saviour. Thus the dove of divine grace carries the olive branch of peace to one entering the ark with Noah; thus wisdom, symbolized through Rebecca, runs to meet one going out into the field of the world with Isaac by the grace of meditation; thus mysteries that may not be disclosed to a wise person in the flesh are revealed to one carried into heaven with Paul.[^med]

    \noindent For 'carnaliter sapienti', cf. Cassiodorus, *Expositio psalmorum* 131, @adriaen:1958magni [p. 2:1196, line 65].

\noindent In essence, Alexander suggests that meditation allows one to approach the divine perspective on the world, seeing without restrictions of time or space, delighting in the good in all things without being allured by their faults.

Alexander was not the only Augustinian to create examples of how to engage in Hugh's idea for meditation. Richard of Saint Victor also elucidates the relationship between meditation and contemplation [e.g. *Beniamin maior* 1.3, @grosfillier:2013contemplatione, pp. 94], though no evidence has yet been found that Alexander read his work. Also writing in the early thirteenth century, Alexander of Ashby specifically highlights the *Didascalicon* as an introduction to understanding Scripture in its spiritual senses [@dinkovabruun:1999alexander, pp. 109, 200; @dinkovabruun:2004alexandri, p. 10, lines 111–118; @dinkovabruun:2008rewriting, p. 270], the primary focus of his *Meditationes* [@bestul:1990meditationes; @morenzoni:2004alexandri, pp. 391–451]. Edmund of Abingdon also influenced by the spirituality of the Victorines [his debt to Hugh of St Victor is explained in @forshaw:1972edmunds; @forshaw:1973edmund, pp. 20–21]; he was not himself an Augustinian, but lived in one of its priories for a year and also died in one [@lawrence:2004edmund]. The common thread in these works is not only an exploration of meditation, but also a deep committment to pastoral care.

## Public and private meditation

Historians have consistently noted Augustinian concern for the *cura animarum* as one of the order's defining features [see esp. @chibnall:1967monks; @montaubin:2009chanoines; @wood:2009augustinians]. Nonetheless, the extent to which the canons personally served the parishes under the supervision of their abbeys remains ambiguous. Most of what Alexander writes suggests that the scope and anticipated readership of his meditations was limited to cloistered communities, but he may have had wider goals. In considering not only traditional focal points of devotion such as the Virgin Mary, but also minor women of the Old Testament, alongside his extolling of the married state,[^grauia] he may have had the ambition of training them to work with the external world. The focus of his meditations is nonetheless on building up individuals within the context of a cloistered community.

[^grauia]: *Super cantica* 1.4, Oxford, Magdalen College, 149, fol. 5rb:

    <div lang="la">
    > Preterea docuimus publice in scolis et adhuc asserimus. actionem illam mariti qua debitum uxori legitime persoluit⸵ meritoriam esse posse uite eterne.

    </div>

Alexander's interest in pastoral care is visible not only in his meditations, but many other of his works. His philosophy of administration is summarized in *Corrogationes noui Promethei*: 'What befits the abbot who desires to be loved more than to be feared? Let love rule from him, and after that fear.'[^fear] He presumably speaks as an abbot himself, but there is no specific evidence to date the work [other arguments for a late composition are presented in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 60–61; @cropp:1991critical, pp. 47–52]. Unfortunately, no more specific examples survive to indicate how Alexander might have applied his principles in administration. The letters of Alan of Tewkesbury, who likely wrote to Alexander for Christological advice, applies exegesis to resolve everyday issues and determine how references in the Gospel might effect monastic life [@harris:1982influences, pp. 8–10]. Alexander's proposal to teach morals through tropology, and the framing of his 'consolatory mediations' as introduced in *Super cantica* as particularly effective in soothing a wounded soul, can be taken in a similar vein.

[^fear]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei*, lines 1–2, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, lat. 11867, fol. 231va: @cropp:1991critical [p. 163]; as emended by @gärtner:2011auftakt:

    <div lang="la">
    > | Quid decet abbatem qui plus optabit amari
    > |     Quam metui? regnet hinc amor, inde metus.
    </div>

The meditative commentaries appear to envisage both oral delivery and personal reading. Alexander's meditations often address the 'pie lector', but also addresses an audience as 'uiri fratres' and occasionally gives relative temporal references [e.g. *Super cantica* 4.12, cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 104]. The same pattern also occurs in Alexander's sermons [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 23, 92]. The problem is similar to Bernard of Clairvaux's *Sermons on the Song of Songs*: scholars have debated for decades whether their stylistic qualities indicate whether they were purely literary compositions [@leclercq:1976were; @holdsworth:1998were]. The most recent assessment argues that they are true sermons that Bernard delivered, edited for a reading audience. The same is presumably true for Alexander's meditations, given polish after an initial delivery in chapter at Cirencester, but the exact context in which this would have taken place is difficult to determine. The *Ordo monasterii* specifies that adherents should undertake three hours of reading each day at the same time, in addition to listening to readings at meals [*Ordo monasterii* 3, 7, @lawless:1987augustine, 74–75, 76–77]; the *Praeceptum* only underlines these points [*Praeceptum* 2.4, 3.2, 4.9–10, @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85, 96–97]. In the twelfth century, the Bridlington Dialogue attempt to elucidate the intent of these guidelines for the use of books, based on Richard of St Victor's *De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis* [@webber:1998libraries, p. xxi; from @lawson:1960bridlington, p. 162; Richard's text is edited in @colker:1962richard, p. 219]. The Augustinian canons themselves had little idea what to make of their rule, and Richard and the *Bridlington Dialogue* tend towards liberality in their interpretations. Nonetheless, one can determine that there were specific daily periods for both reading and oral delivery of texts, providing an incubator for Alexander's writings.

This dual public-private approach to books revolves around the term *speculum* ('mirror'). The image may originate with the Augustinian *Praeceptum*: 'These precepts should be read to you once a week, so that you will see yourselves in this little book as in a mirror and not neglect anything through forgetfulness.' [*Praeceptum* 8.2, @lawless:1987augustine, pp. 102–103: 'Vt autem uos in hoc libello tamquam in speculo possitis inspicere, ne per obliuionem aliquid neglegatis, semel in septimana uobis legatur.'] This passage is probably what Alexander has in mind when he writes in *De naturis rerum* that 'a person is the most certain mirror of himself.'^[*De naturis rerum* 3.Proem.2, Oxford, Magdalen College, 139, fol. 72v: 'Homo etiam⸵ sui ipsius certissimum est speculum.'] Most poignantly, he addresses his *Super mulierem fortem* as 'speculum animi mei' in the closing paragraph:

> Perhaps, book, you will outlive your Alexander. For worms will eat me before bookworms gnaw you away. My body is owed to worms; you will be abolished by bookworms. You are the mirror of my soul; you are the conveyor of my meditations, the most certain judge of our intentions; you are the faithful messenger of the feelings of my mind, the sweet comfort of sorrow; you are the witness of a truthful conscience. To you, as though to a faithful depositary, I have commended the secrets of my heart. You faithfully return to me the things which I have trusted to your faith; in you I read myself. You will come into the hand of some other devout reader, who will think fit to pour out prayers for me. Then indeed, little book, you will be handed over to the Lord: then you will reward your Alexander with a most pleasing exchange. He will conquer – and I do not begrudge my labour for the prayer of a devout reader – who now puts you in his lap, now moves you to his breast, sometimes places you under his head as a sweet pillow, sometimes caresses you gently with happy hands; for me he will earnestly entreat Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, God, through endless ages of ages. Amen.[^fortasse]

    \noindent Also quoted in @williams:1908gloucestershire [pp. 110-111]; @hunt:1984schools [p. 17]; another translation in @thorndike:1923history [pp. 2:203–4], who appears to have misread some words.

\noindent It can indeed be argued that *Super mulierem fortem* is Alexander's most personal book, but there was evidently nothing private about it. If one takes the passage literally, it might challenge notions of what physically constitutes a devotional book: Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94 still has what appears to be its original medieval binding, with soft white tawed leather over wooden boards, and might make a rather decent pillow by monastic standards: the *Super mulierem fortem* pages measure 386 × 283 mm. By contrast, the copy from Reading, now Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 528 (*SC* 2221), measures 208 × 131 mm, far too small to facilitate slumber for a grown adult. More likely, this is another example of Alexander using himself as the target of ridicule while making a serious point. His comments in *Corrogationes noui Promethei* on the role of an abbot shed further light on his usage: 'May the pastor be to his own mirror, book, skill, model of the honest; form, measure, guidance, rule, life.'[^life] The key point is ultimately that the book acts as a proxy for Alexander himself, deliving teaching and care in his absence.

[^life]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei* 137–38, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, lat. 11867, fol. 232ra; @cropp:1991critical [p. 169]:

## Innovation through meditation

By examining Alexander's biblical commentaries using his own framing of the works as meditations, the extent of the influence of the Augustinian canons on his writing becomes much clearer. His works become far more palatable to a reader today as it becomes apparent that he was not merely rewriting ancient authors, but experimenting to see how Hugh of St Victor's idea for a sort of scholastic mysticism might be practised. He does something more than follow the typical examples of twelfth-century scholastics: he not only provides his readers and listeners with information about the world, but teaches them what to do with it.
