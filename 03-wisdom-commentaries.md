# *Speculum animi mei:* Alexander's Meditations

The crowning works of Alexander's literary career are his commentaries on the Wisdom books: *De naturis rerum*, on Ecclesiastes; *Laus beatissime uirginis*, on the Song of Songs; an unfinished book projected to treat the entirety of Proverbs; and the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, considering the end of Proverbs. These are often assumed to be purely 'monastic' products, having little relation to his earlier writings. They deal with many topics beyond the obvious scope of the biblical texts, which has prompted some scholars to label them as encyclopedias, and others to deride them as 'the overflow of his personal devotion' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 106]. These are accurate descriptions of how modern readers react to these works, but they do not fit the context of the early thirteenth century. When Alexander himself refers to these works, he calls them *meditationes*, seeking to draw his audience to a higher level of thought in the natural progression of reading presented by Augustinian writers, but rarely put into practice. This classification also shows that his *Solatium fidelis anime* and *Meditatio de Magdalena* fit into the same category. Together, these works represent the cumulation of Alexander's experience in the schools and the Augustinian order.

## Alexander's commentaries on the Wisdom books

The Wisdom books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs were traditionally understood in the Middle Ages as representing the three branches of knowledge – *practica*, *physica*, and *????*.<!-- src-->

- Alexander wrote on Wisdom books in order to represent all spheres of knowledge




<!-- Is there a source for any of this? -->

> The book of Proverbs owes itself to ebbing contemplation, by which someone turns towards the state of his condition; Ecclesiastes is answerable to the consideration of the worldly vanities; the book of Canticles indulges divine contemplation. Idida<!--?--> shouts that 'the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.' Ecclesiastes preaches, saying, 'Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.' Solomon sighs for the delights of peace, saying, 'May he kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.'

Prudence and hope and temperance confer to you the name of a preacher. Prudence, truly investigating the natures of transitory things, understands them to be subject to vanities. Hope, now holding God himself with the hand of desire, declares that everything apart from God is subject to manifold vanity. Temperance pondering that what is adequate by nature is restrained,<!--?--> knows that the love of temporal things is to be driven out. Holy love and devotion delight to be loved with a kiss and embraces.

> In threefold contemplation, therefore, the three works of three-named Solomon are complying: to enter, to depart, to surpass. To enter the chamber of the heart, to enter the dug earth, and to know your situation. The dug earth is the land of free will, which, if it is tilled well by the discipline of a farmer, will produce glad crops of virtues. Therefore, a person should meet himself with the doors of the spirit closed, lest wandering thoughts come near secret tracks, disturbers of inner stilness; he should consult the conscience as to whether, with his way directed through the ways of salvation, he is aimed towards the appropriate goal. Afterwards, to go depart from your land with Abraham, that is from the land of free will, and from your family, now untroubled by the disturbances of the mind – to depart, I say, by the steps of contemplation, to perceiving the vanities of things and their advantages.

These works probably took their original form as oral addresses, later revised for formal recording in a manuscript. On this point, it is very helpful to compare the sermons on the Song of Songs by Bernard of Clairvaux, whose precise method delivery has long been a matter of contention; it is not altogether clear whether these in fact given as sermons in chapter, or whether they were a strictly literary exercise. Alexander’s works contribute to the question by adding an organizational scheme that is evidently designed to allow the book to be used as a reference tool.

To distinguish them from Alexander’s other commentaries, these have been categorized as ‘monastic’, and on a certain level this is an appropriate designation, in terms of following in a ruminative pattern akin to that of, for instance, Rupert of Deutz, or the more contemporary commentary on Lamentations by William of Malmesbury. The meditation on Mary Magdalene and *Solatium fidelis anime* are also included in this category. What is striking about Alexander’s commentaries is their personal nature. The *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* appears to be a series of addresses given by Alexander as abbot to his fellow canons; but at the end of this work, he refers to it as *speculum animi mei* – the mirror of his soul. What is the meaning of this, and what function would this have served within his community?

Comment in Rule of St Augustine:

>| These precepts should be read to you once a week,
>| so that you will see yourselves
>| in this little book as in a mirror
>| and not neglect anything through forgetfulness.[^forget]

[^forget]: *Praeceptum* 8.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 102–3:

    >| Ut autem uos in hoc libello
    >| tamquam in speculo possitis inspicere,
    >| ne per obliuionem aliquid neglegatis,
    >| semel in septimana uobis legatur.

This passage is probably what Alexander Neckam has in mind when he refers to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* as *speculum animi mei*, as we will see later.

Hunt distinguishes these as being of a ‘scholastic type’, probably deriving from Alexander’s teaching days at Oxford [@hunt:1984schools, p. 95].

Alexander Neckam's most famous work, *De naturis rerum*, is most commonly described as an 'encyclopedia' [as in @talaveraesteso:1983historia; @fumagalli:1985due; @berlioz:1994recueils; @ribémont:1995natura; @schuler:2000fabrica; @voorbij:2000purpose; @ribémont:2002renaissance; @schuler:2002rives; @tilliette:2005rhétorique; @záhora:2014nature].<!-- @haye:1997lateinische ? --> This view stems from its first editor's framing of the work, which he stated 'was intended to be a manual of the scientific knowledge of the time' [@wright:1863alexandri, p. xiv]. In reality, the published portion of the work is an introduction to a scriptural commentary. Wright's willful ignorance of what follows runs so deep that he believes it was a commentary on 'Ecclesiasticus' rather than Ecclesiastes [@wright:1863alexandri, p. lxvii]. Understanding *De naturis rerum* as an encyclopedia may help to provide context for some of the works that followed it to which the label has been retroactively applied, but it tells us relatively little about how Alexander conceived of his work, but it has also set up false expectations for Alexander's work, meaning that modern audiences are often less than receptive.

### *Meditatio de Magdalena*

### *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*

Hunt places the writing of *Super Mulierem fortem* during Alexander's abbacy, on the basis that 'he assumes the tone of a superior giving instruction.' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 28] But he also believes that the heading to the *Speculum*, which refers to him as 'magister Alexander canonicus Cirencestrie' (R, fol. 1ra), indicates that this is an earlier work. If so, *Super Mulierem fortem* must be dated to before 1213, since the *Speculum* refers to it once, close to the beginning [1.2.10: R, fol. 5va, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 23].

*Super Mulierem fortem* includes cross-references to Alexander's *Laus beatissime uirginis*^['Dulcissima est historialis intelligentie ueritas. quam expositione luculenta declarauimus in opere nostro⸵ quod in laudes gloriose dei genitricis feliciter consummauimus.' J, fol. 99vb.] as well as his *Meditatio de Magdalena*.^['Beata autem magdalena cuius laudibus iterato deseruire stilus noster gloriatur'. J, fol. 79ra.] There is

## Alexander's meditations as a product of Cirencester

Meditations could have been drafted at Oxford, but Cirencester was probably needed to carry out his publication programme.



## Meditation and the Augustinians




> Contemplation is associated with spiritual insight (e.g., Solatium 14ra: “Dies septimus est sabbatissimus mentis, quo mens requiescit in operibus dei delectans, aut in contemplationem diuine maiestatis, per apotheosim rapta, delicias eterne dulcedinis prelibat”). Meditation, on the other hand, takes as its subject the present situation of man, and leads to his improvement before he engages in flights of contemplation (Solatium 19va: “Placet etiam dulcedini misericordie dei ut aues hoc est subtiles meditationes quibus contemp- nimus uaga ista bona et fluctuantia multiplicentur in nobis super terram liberi arbitrii ... Similiter meditationes honeste adornant rerum universitatem sicut omnia honesta opera creaturarum numerum adornant”). [@záhora:2011tropology, p. 119n27]

Hunt had very little to say about Alexander's meditations. 'They are the overflow of his personal devotion.' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 106] ** = 'consolatory meditations'

- Hunt's version: not a fan, 'the overflow of [Alexander's] personal devotion' <!-- adjust q, taken from Bestul --> [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 106–107]
- there is a longer tradition of this



The idea of presenting an analytic work as a meditation was hardly new: Anselm of Canterbury is also known for having done this [cf. @cottier:2001anima].

Instead, this work should be understood as one of a series of meditative biblical commentaries he wrote while at Cirencester: along with *De naturis rerum*, there survive a commentary on the *Song of Songs*, also called *Laus beatissime uirginis* [@mcdonough:2004laus]; the *Tractatus super Parabolas Salomonis*, an incomplete commentary covering Proverbs 1:1–3:27; the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, a threefold commentary on Proverbs 31:10–31; and a *Meditatio de Magdalena* [edited in @bestul:1999meditation]. Whenever Alexander himself refers to one of these books, he calls it a 'meditatio'. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how Alexander used this idea from the tradition of monastic biblical commentaries to meet the needs of his community, and to consider its relationship to himself, as when in the conclusion to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* he calls the book 'speculum animi mei' (J, fol. 125ra).

<!--Do we need more engagement with the arguments cited above? -->

> And now those things which pertain to reading have been explained as lucidly and briefly as we know how. But as for the remaining part of learning, namely meditation, I omit saying anything about it in the present work because so great a matter requires a special treatise, and it is more worthy to be altogether silent about a matter of this sort than to say anything about it imperfectly. For it is a thing truly subtle and at the same time delightful, one which both educates beginners and exercises the perfect, one which has not yet been treated in writing and which therefore deserves all the more to be followed up.

bit like @leclercq:1982love [p. 16]:

> In secular usage, *meditari* means, in a general way, to think, to reflect, as does *cogitare* or *considerare*; but, more than these, it often implies an affinity with the practical or even moral order. It implies thinking of a thing with the intent to do it; in other words, to prepare oneself for it, to prefigure it in the mind, to desire it, in a way, to do it in advance briefly, to practice it.

- cites TLL; p. 73 on lectio vs. med.

At the beginning of his commentary on Proverbs, Alexander holds meditation in high regard:

> Human meditation at one moment is turned back on man himself; at another it passes to the other created things; sometimes it is directed to the author of things. While indeed it is turned back to man, contemplation is either directed round those things that look to the dignity of a noble creature, or on those that sink to the fragility of the human condition. When, however, reason, just as if it were sitting in a watchtower, discerns the changes of transitory things, and at times their vanity, it often discovers their usefulness. But while it ventures on that immeasurable light itself, on the contrary devotion rejoices to transfix the sharpness of the mind, for the eye of love runs back gladly to the beloved: sometimes it sweetly sees the humility of taking up humanity, sometimes it reverently regards the height of divine majesty. Therefore reason, entering the inner chamber of the heart and concentrating its thoughts inwards, considers the dignity and fragility of human nature; crossing to the show of the worldly theatre, it recognizes the vanity and usefulness of things; raising itself above itself, it considers the humanity and divinity of the saviour. Thus the dove of divine grace carries the olive-branch of peace to one entering the ark with Noah; thus wisdom, symbolized through Rebecca, runs to meet one going out into the field of the world with Isaac by the grace of meditation; thus mysteries are revealed to one carried into heaven with Paul, which it will not be permitted to disclose to a wise man in the flesh.[^med]

[^med]: *Super parabolas* Prol.1 (Jesus College 94, fol. 57ra):

    > Meditatio humana nunc in ipsum hominem reflectitur. nunc in ceteras transit creaturas⸵ nunc in auctorem rerum. dirigitur. Dum uero in hominem reciprocatur. aut circa ea que spectant ad nobilis creature dignitatem uersatur consideratio⸵ aut in iis que uergunt ad humane conditionis fragilitatem. Cum autem tanquam in specula residens ratio˷ rerum transitoriarum. cernit alterationes⸵ quandoque ipsarum uanitatem˷ non numquam earundem deprehendit utilitatem. Set dum in illud illud lumen immensum audet. immo gaudet mentis aciem figere deuotio˷ ad dilectum enim libenter recurrit amoris oculus⸵ nunc humanitatis assumpte humilitatem dulciter. nunc diuine maiestatis sublimitatem reuerenter intuetur. Ingrediens igitur ratio thalamum cordis et se intra se colligens⸵ dignitatem nature humane et fragilitatem considerat. transiens ad spectacula theatri mundialis⸵ rerum agnoscit uanitatem et utilitatem. erigens se supra se⸵ contemplatur humanitatem saluatoris et diuinitatem. Sic ingredienti archam cum Noe⸵ deferet columba diuine gratie⸝ ramum oliue pacis. sic egredienti in agrum mundi istius cum Ysaac gratia meditationis⸵ occurret sapientia per Rebeccam designata. sic rapto in celum cum Paulo⸵ reuelabuntur archana. que non licebit manifestari homini carnaliter sapienti.

## *Meditatio* and the work of an abbot

One of the most instructive texts on Alexander's philosophy of administration is the collection *Corrogationes noui Promethei* (or *Promothei*). The collection is framed as advice to abbots:

> | What befits the abbot who desires to be loved more
> |     than to be feared? Let love rule from him, and after that fear.

> | Quid decet abbatem qui plus optabit amari
> |     Quam metui? regnet hinc amor, inde metus. [*CNP*, fol. 231va: @cropp:1991critical, lines 1–2; as emended by @gärtner:2011auftakt]

The tone allows the work to be dated to after his election in 1213. It would be rather odd for Alexander to write this if he were not himself an abbot, for what follows gives the impression of being prescriptive rather than humble suggestions for improvement from an underling [other arguments for a late composition are presented in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 60–61; @cropp:1991critical, pp. 47–52].

There has been confusion about the meaning of the title *Corrogationes Promethei* since Alexander's own time [the problem is examined in detail by @cropp:1991critical, pp. 52–71]. A letter survives with a thirteenth-century copy of the work glossing the title as 'congregationes sapientis siue prudentis' ('collections of a wise or prudent man') [Évreux, Bibliothèque municipale, L. 72, fol. 1v: printed by @omont:1887catalogue, p. 65; @meyer:1896notice, pp. 651–652; @guéry:1917histoire, pp. 393–394]. Meyer felt that the title implied a complaint, preferring to translate the title as 'Travaux d'un homme condamné à l'oisiveté' [@meyer:1896notice, p. 653]. In support of this view, he cites a preface by the younger Peter of Blois, a canon of Chartres, comparing himself to the suffering and banished Prometheus, 'a scolasticis semotus deliciis' [@reimarus:1837petri, p. 1]. Did Alexander think of himself as exiled to Cirencester, separated from the scholastic delights of Paris and Oxford? Probably not – and even if he did, he was far too optimistic to say it openly. Hunt notes that Prometheus is presented as a teacher when the work is mentioned in *De naturis rerum*; he glosses the title as 'collections of an instructor in the rudiments' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 36]. Wedge, in an attempt to reconcile the three views, amplifies it further: 'collections of a scholar who has only his leisure hours to devote to the study of the Scripture, being at other times weighed down by more worldly duties' [@wedge:1967alexander, p. 77]. <!-- check quotation --> Cropp further points out a Servian interpretation of Prometheus as found in the Third Vatican Mythographer, in which he is presented as a self-sacrificing scholar and instructor [@cropp:1991critical, pp. 69–71]. Perhaps most convincing is the suggestion of the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources* of a reference to *Rhetorica ad Herennium* 4.9, which Alexander could have seen either in the original or in Priscian's quotation of the passage in *Ars grammatica* 3.34 (GL 2:108, lines 10–11). This would make the title a self-deprecating and slightly humorous one – appropriate to Alexander's character.

The first section of the poem presents an abbot who was benevolent but firm, providing instruction that would be both helpful and enjoyable:

> | Therefore let the teacher teach by deed and word;
> |     let honey-sweet words advance from the comb of his mouth.
> | Let the usefulness of his words form a foundation, the teaching of the faithful
> |     delight, but it pleases more by usefulness.[^use]

[^use]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei* 109–112 (BnF lat. 11867, fol. 232ra), @cropp:1991critical, 167–68:

    > | Instruat ergo suos, re, uerbo, doctor; ab oris
    > |     Eius procedant mellea uerba fauo.
    > | Vtilitas uerbis subsit, doctrina fidelis
    > |     Delectat, set plus utilitate iuuat.



Above all, he is to be both learned and virtuous:

> | Sit pastor speculum, liber, ars, exemplar honesti;
> |     Forma, modus, regimen, regula, uita suis.

> | May the pastor be to his own mirror, book, skill, model of the honest;
> |     Form, measure, guidance, rule, life. [*CNP*, fol. 232ra: @cropp:1991critical, lines 137–38]

Unfortunately, no letters from Alexander survive that might show in practice how he carried this out, but there are other examples from his time. Alan of Tewkesbury, for instance, applies exegesis to resolve everyday issues and determine how references in the Gospel might effect monastic life. He may have written to Alexander for christological advice [@harris:1982influences, pp. 8–10].

<!--abbots not fond of learning: @harris:1982influences, p. 13n68; @hunt:1936english, p. 26; @leclercq:1982love, p. 241–242 (or 2nd ed?) -->

If Alexander calls his book 'speculum animi mei' (*SMF*, J, fol. 125r) or his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum*, what does it mean for an abbot to be a mirror to his flock?

## The uses of books among the Augustinians

Alexander's meditations fit into the role

The Rule of St Augustine is maddeningly unspecific, and this is no less the case in its discussion of intellectual pursuits. The *Ordo monasterii* only specifies that adherents should undertake three hours of reading each day at the same time, in addition to listening to readings at meals [*Ordo monasterii* 3, 7, @lawless:1987augustine, 74–75, 76–77]; the *Praeceptum* only underlines these points [*Praeceptum* 2.4, 3.2, 4.9–10, @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85, 96–97]. In the twelfth century, an attempt was made to determine precisely what this meant in the *Colloquium magistri et discipuli in regulam beati Augustini de uita clericorum* (or *Bridlington Dialogue*), based on Richard of St Victor's *De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis* [@webber:1998libraries, p. xxi; from @lawson:1960bridlington, p. 162; Richard's text is edited in @colker:1962richard, p. 219]. It appears that the Augustinian canons themselves had little idea what to make of such strictures. Richard and the *Bridlington Dialogue* tend towards liberality in their interpretations.
