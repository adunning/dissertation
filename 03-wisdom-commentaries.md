# *Speculum animi mei:* Alexander's Meditations

The crowning works of Alexander's literary career are his commentaries on the Wisdom books: *Laus beatissime uirginis*, on the Song of Songs; *De naturis rerum*, on Ecclesiastes; the *Tractatus super parabolas Salomonis*, projected to treat the entirety of Proverbs but left unfinished; and the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, considering the end of Proverbs. The limited research that has been conducted on these works has assumed them to be purely 'monastic' products, having little relation to his earlier writings, in contrast to his 'scholastic' work. They deal with many topics beyond the obvious scope of the biblical texts, which has prompted some scholars to label them as encyclopedias, and others to deride them as 'the overflow of his personal devotion' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 106]. There is some truth in both of these approaches: the encyclopedic argument is to some extent supported by the adaptation of his materials by Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais later in the thirteenth century [@záhora:2014nature, pp. 230–231]. The commentaries are undeniably designed to prompt emotional fervour, but they should not consequently be viewed as thoughtless. Neither of these approaches allow one to read the works in the way in which they were intended, or to understand them within the context of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. When Alexander himself refers to these works, he calls them *meditationes*, seeking to draw his audience to a higher level of thought in the natural progression of reading presented by Augustinians such as Hugh of St Victor, but rarely put into practice. This classification also draws his *Solatium fidelis anime* and *Meditatio de Magdalena* into the same category. As Hunt first noted, Alexander's interpretative tool of choice in these commmentaries is tropology [@hunt:1984schools, p. 97]. Together, these meditations represent the cumulation of Alexander's experience in the schools and the Augustinian order.

## Alexander's biblical commentaries

The distinction between Alexander's works on the Bible as monastic and scholastic breaks down immediately once one realizes that his meditations are closest in style to his sermons – which are his only works certainly written before he became a regular canon. While the *Glose super psalterium* and *Corrogationes Promethei* cannot be placed among his meditations, they were both certainly written from an Augustinian cloister. These works are both primarily informational, the former providing an orientation to modern scholarship on the Psalter, and the latter investigating unusual words in the Bible that was part of the growing demand for handy reference tools for preachers in all clerical circles. The provenance of surviving copies suggests that they were both most popular among the cloistered (though the survival of records in general is more consistent from this group), and the latter also had some secular owners. The meditations of *Solatium*, *Laus uirginis*, *De naturis rerum*, *Super parabolas*, *De Magdalena*, and *Super Mulierem fortem* were specifically designed to meet the pastoral needs of religious communities, and to this extent the 'monastic' label fits, but their contents are highly dependent on Alexander's scholastic experience.

Working through these works in the apparent order of their completion allows one to see the development of the meditation format, originating with his sermons (as established above, '[The chronology of Alexander's works as an Augustinian]'). Alexander's biblical scholarship truly begins with his sermons, surviving both from before his time as a regular canon and after. His approach can be described as highly practical, focusing on utility rather than elegance, while emphasizing the responsible use of rhetoric to drive home one's point [see quotations in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 84–85]. This immediately shifts the view of the Augustinians, for whom it has been argued that homiletics 'had become something of a dead letter' [@dickinson:1950origins, p. 227], based on a perceived lack of evidence. He seems to have gained some fame as a preacher, with copies of his sermons remaining in demand after his death (see below, '[Walter's edition of Alexander's sermons]'); several stories circulated in England and on the continent that depicted him in this role [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 15–16]. It is this style and focus on the care of souls that informs his meditative commentaries.

### *Glose super psalterium*

Alexander's first formal biblical commentary, *Super psalterium*, is also his first work unquestionably written as an Augustinian. In this, he drew not on his experience as a preacher, but as a lecturer, following a style most similar to his commentaries on Martianus Capella and the Athanasian Creed, and what he would have heard from his masters at the schools in Paris, referring specifically to the opinion of his own unnamed master<!-- citation?-->. He takes a traditional approach to biblical interpretation in a classroom setting, concentrating on outlining the authorities for the interpretation of a given passage, especially the ubiquitous *Glosa* [the only analysis of this work is @hunt:1984schools, pp. 97–103]. He weighs between these authorities, and uses them to drive home key theological lessons.

The booklet containing this work in [Oxford, Jesus College, 94], as shown in chapter 5 below, appears to be a product of Oxford rather than Cirencester, and is extensively annotated in several versions of Alexander's own hand, most likely representing his revisions to the lectures as he repeated them. It was also, however, designed for dissemination, including a formal accessus that sets out the four senses in which he will expound the text (history, allegory, tropology, anagogy). His work on this book is solid; in some surviving manuscripts, it is presented in a way similar to manuscripts of the *Glosa* itself, with the full text of Psalms given in a centre column, and the commentary surrounding it, facilitating its use in the classroom. This layout was also applied to many copies of Peter Lombard's commentary on the Psalms, and Alexander's glosses gained some use; at least eleven copies are known to have existed. The book functions as an admirable update of Peter Lombard, presenting the cutting edge of scholarship in the late twelfth century, but there is nothing innovative about its approach; records of lectures on the Psalms were common, and there was no obvious need that Alexander's work filled in contrast to his peers. He did not take the same approach with the lectures that he indicates he gave on Ezekiel, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs for publication [@hunt:1984schools, p. 8].

### *Solatium fidelis anime*

In Alexander's following works, he returned to his strength in preaching; his commentaries are still visibly supported by his reading of the authorities, but quotes them directly with much less frequency. This produces a much more original format: a treatise on a particular subject that happens to follow the framework of a biblical text. His next work after *Super psalterium* is commentary on Genesis 1:10–2:3. There is nothing explicitly indicating whether it was a product of Oxford or Cirencester. In the sole surviving manuscript, once belonging to St Augustine's, Canterbury and now in the cathedral libary, it is given the heading 'Tractatus moralium super Genesim qui dicitur Solatium fidelis anime'. The work never seems to have achieved wide dissemination, although Alexander refers to it in *De naturis rerum* [*De naturis rerum* 2.1, @wright:1863alexandri, p. 127]; there are no records of copies having existed elsewhere (as shown below, '[Results of the dissemination effort]'). This lends weight to a general sense that the work was somewhat experimental.

This is also the first of Alexander's commentaries that can be labelled as one of his 'meditations', though the concept has not yet been fully developed. In contrast to the approach of his glosses on the Psalms that seek to provide a balanced approach to the text, Alexander declares the aim of *Solatium* to be a particular sense of interpretation: 'saving anagogy for other treatises, in this work I will give particular attention to tropology' [*Solatium*, Canterbury, Cathedral Library, Lit. B. 6 (4), fol. 2ra: 'Anagogen itaque tractatibus aliis reseruans, specialem in hoc opere tropologie daturus sum operam.' Quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 97; @záhora:2014nature, pp. 68–69; @záhora:2011tropology, p. 119]. The mechanics of this have been laid out by Tomáš Záhora [@záhora:2014nature, pp. 65–72; @záhora:2011tropology]. Each of the seven days of creation is linked to an action open to the soul that allows it to be infused with grace, and second to seven corresponding gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 11:2–3). The pattern is similar to many medieval accounts of the virtues, notably Hugh of St Victor's *De quinque septenis*, which portrays each of the gifts of the Holy Spirit as being given in response to seven petitions in the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) [@dunning:2016hugh; for a comparison of Hugh's categories with Augustine, Paschasius Radbertus, and Gregory the Great, see @rehm:1994bebilderte, pp. 7–14]. Closely linked to tropology in *Solatium* is the idea of meditation, portrayed in the terms of the Victorines: it is a consideration of created things, gradually bringing a person to a state fit for contemplation [*Solatium*, fols 19va and 14ra, quoted in @záhora:2011tropology, p. 119n27]. Alexander's meditations are an attempt to undertake this practice – in other words, his endeavour to show his readers what other Augustinians had already established as the direct route to salvation.

### *Laus beatissime uirginis*: Commentary on the Song of Songs

*Laus beatissime uirginis*, as Alexander refers to his commentary on the Song of Songs, picks up where he left off in *Solatium*. Its proem describes the virtues of humility and obedience, continuing through Genesis with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other figures of the Old Testament. These are all portrayed as forerunners of the Virgin Mary, herself the ideal model for human emulation. The first chapters of Book 1 pick up not at the beginning of the Song of Songs, but once again with the beginning of Genesis. If Alexander can be taken at his word, the work was conceived from the outset as the first of a series of commentaries on the Wisdom books. He explains later in *Super parabolas* that the order of the books' interpretation differs from that of their appearance ('just as the order of the edition of the books of Aristotle'): the Song of Songs is logically the first book in terms of exposition, as it addresses the Incarnation; Ecclesiastes relates to the time of the preaching of the Apostles; and Proverbs to the time of the rise of heretics.[^order]

[^order]: *Super parabolas* Proem.6, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 59rb:

    > Hec in medium protulimus⸵ tropologie deseruientes. Si enim allegorie stilus obsequatur⸵ uidebitur intelligenti liber canticorum primus esse in ordine trium operum salomonis. sicut ordo editionis librorum aristotilis⸵ contrarius est ordini expositionis eorundem. Liber igitur canticorum⸵ ad misterium incarnationis. ecclesiastes⸵ ad tempus predicationis apostolice. liber parabolarum⸵ ad tempora heresum subortarum refertur. Hinc est quod in hoc opere quod premanibus habemus⸵ nomine meretricis˷ tipice designatur hereticorum peruersa doctrina. Quoniam uero per gloriosam uirginem cuncte hereses erant interimende⸵ transfert se in spiritu in hoc opere salomon quandoque ad misterium incarnationis.

Like *Solatium*, *Laus uirginis* is founded on a tropological understanding of its text, though it takes a much more balanced approach, while further putting the idea of meditation into practice. Specific chapters are labelled 'tropological expositions' (e.g. 2.9, 2.15) or allegories (e.g. 2.10), but Alexander mostly focuses on a mystical understanding of a literal reading of the text (as he explains in 1.2, 'De mistico intellectu et sensu litterali'). Rachel Fulton Brown has shown that Alexander draws not on the traditional allegorical tradition of interpreting the Song of Songs, understanding it as a dialogue between the church and Christ, but on a frame that originated in Carolingian liturgies, taking the text as a literal dialogue between the Virgin Mary and Christ as a child [@fulton:1996mimetic, p. 90]. In Alexander's case, a basis in this literal sense of the text is only logical, if meditation is to focus on understanding the created in order to attain contemplation of the divine.

It is also in *Laus beatissime uirginis* that Alexander develops what he later calls 'consolatory meditations'. He cites Augustine, Gregory, and Anselm of Canterbury as other laudible writers of meditations [*Laus uirginis* 6.13, quoted in @hunt:1984schools, p. 107]. These typically focus on visualizing the subject he describes in detail. It is difficult for modern readers to relate to these passages due to their length and rhetoric, and Hunt characterizes them as essentially meaningless devotional writing [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 97, 106–107]. It seems this was a criticism Alexander faced even in his own day, and he later explains in *Super parabolas* that this is a deliberate choice:

> I have primarily aimed to devote myself to tropology, so that passages of allegory may be saved for a particular case. And let not a casual observer accuse me of long-windedness; for it is pleasing not to take the duty of an expositor, but to revive the souls of a cloister with consolatory meditations, sometimes shaken by wrongful troubles, and sometimes wounded by its own arrows.[^tropologie]

It should be no surprise that readers who have approached Alexander's commentaries looking for an encyclopedia or a more advanced version of the *Glosa* have come away disappointed, but that does not meant that they were any less innovative in their own day. There is great potential for reading them in the wrong way if one is unaware of their explicit function as a tool for pastoral care.

[^tropologie]: *Super parabolas* Proem.6, Oxford, Jesus College, 94, fol. 59rb–va, also quoted in @hunt:1984schools, 97:

    > Principaliter uero tropologie indulgere proposui. ita ut allegorie loca quedam specialiter reseruentur. Nec me prolixitatis arguat temerarius arbiter. neque enim expositoris officium tantum⸝ assumere libet⸵ set etiam consolatoriis meditationibus [59va] recreare claustralium animos⸝ non nunquam iniustis uexatos molestiis. non nunquam propriis sautiatos iaculis.

### *Corrogationes Promethei*

The next work of biblical scholarship Alexander completed after *Laus beatissime uirginis* also became his most popular: *Corrogationes Promethei* is known to have existed in some eighty-two known copies. This book is much more closely aligned with *Super psalterium* than the Wisdom commentaries. It is divided into two parts, the first summarizing key grammatical principles (largely based on Priscian) and the second working through the entire Bible, providing explanations of its most obscure words and notes on their spelling. The later metrical version of the work takes a similarly utilitarian approach [brief excerpts printed by @hunt:1991teaching, pp. 1:247–250], and seems to have been conceived, in a typical medieval mode, of presenting verses for memorizing the words it presents [for other examples of this trend, see @dunning:2015samuel].

There has been confusion about the meaning of the title *Corrogationes Promethei* since Alexander's own time [the problem is examined in detail by @cropp:1991critical, pp. 52–71]. A letter survives with a thirteenth-century copy of the work glossing the title as 'collections of a wise or prudent man' ['Congregationes sapientis siue prudentis': Évreux, Bibliothèque municipale, L. 72, fol. 1v: printed by @omont:1887catalogue, p. 65; @meyer:1896notice, pp. 651–652; @guéry:1917histoire, pp. 393–394]. Meyer felt that the title implied a complaint, preferring to translate the title as 'Travaux d'un homme condamné à l'oisiveté' [@meyer:1896notice, p. 653]. In support of this view, he cites a preface by the younger Peter of Blois, a canon of Chartres, comparing himself to the suffering and banished Prometheus, 'a scolasticis semotus deliciis' [@reimarus:1837petri, p. 1]. Did Alexander think of himself as exiled to Cirencester, separated from the scholastic delights of Paris and Oxford? Probably not – and even if he did, he was far too optimistic to say it openly. Hunt notes that Prometheus is presented as a teacher when the work is mentioned in *De naturis rerum*; he glosses the title as 'collections of an instructor in the rudiments' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 36]. Wedge, in an attempt to reconcile the three views, amplifies it further: 'collections of a scholar who has only his leisure hours to devote to the study of the Scripture, being at other times weighed down by more worldly duties' [@wedge:1967alexander, p. 77].<!-- check quotation --> Cropp further points out a Servian interpretation of Prometheus as found in the Third Vatican Mythographer, in which he is presented as a self-sacrificing scholar and instructor [@cropp:1991critical, pp. 69–71]. Perhaps most convincing is the suggestion of the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources* of a reference to *Rhetorica ad Herennium* 4.9 that compares Prometheus to a 'ridiculous master' [@latham:1975dictionary, s.v. 'corrogatio']. Alexander might have seen this in Priscian's quotation of the passage [Priscian, *Ars grammatica* 3.34, @hertz:1855prisciani, 2:108, lines 10–11]. This makes the title a self-deprecating and slightly humorous one.

The relationship of *Corrogationes Promethei* to Alexander's other biblical work is somewhat difficult to determine. One can guess that parts of it were based on his lecture notes, as there are many similarities in approach with *Super psalterium*. At first glance, it would appear to offer a glimpse at Alexander's pure analytical side, but this impression is complicated by *Sol meldunensis* (Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42). This presents several excerpts from *Corrogationes Promethei* (and its citations tend to be accurate) that suggests that there were several sections of the work that sought to contribute some levity similar to the *exemplaria* of his sermons, notably a story of a deacon punished for celebrating a Mass (fols 92r–92v, an added leaf). There are also several passages from a prosimetrical version of *Corrogationes noui Promethei* that is not known to survive, but is mentioned in the library catalogue of the Augustinian canons at Barnwell [@webber:1998libraries, A2.†3].

### *De naturis rerum*: Commentary on Ecclesiastes

What is today Alexander's most famous work, *De naturis rerum*, is most commonly described, anachonistically, as an 'encyclopedia', but within the context of his other biblical commentaries these qualities are seen to be the result of his exegetical program. It is unclear who first popularized the interpretation: it is mentioned in a 1960 letter of Beryl Smalley (quoted above under '[Alexander's reception in modern scholarship]'), and appears on many occasions in later scholarship [@michaudquantin:1966petites; @talaveraesteso:1983historia; @fumagalli:1985due; @berlioz:1994recueils; @ribémont:1995natura; @voorbij:2000purpose; @schuler:2000fabrica; @schuler:2002rives; @ribémont:2002renaissance; @tilliette:2005rhétorique; @keen:2013shifting].<!-- @haye:1997lateinische ? --> These works only engage with the first two books published by Wright, and their interpretation stem directly from his truncation of the work, which he stated 'was intended to be a manual of the scientific knowledge of the time' [@wright:1863alexandri, p. xiv]. His wilful ignorance of what follows runs so deep that he describes it as a commentary on Ecclesiasticus rather than Ecclesiastes [@wright:1863alexandri, pp. xiv, lxvii]. Understanding *De naturis rerum* as an encyclopedia may help to provide context for some of the works following it to which the label has been retroactively applied, but it tells us little about how Alexander conceived of his work.

The most successful treatment of *De naturis rerum* as an encylopedia is that of @záhora:2007tropological [published with some corrections, @záhora:2014nature], pursuing Hunt's observation that in the context of the Ecclesiastes commentary, the true focus of the whole of *De naturis rerum* is tropology. Unfortunately, he pays limited attention to Alexander's other commentaries, and insists on referring to both *De naturis rerum* and *Laus sapientie diuine* as encyclopedias to designate of their primary focus. While he mentions some other descriptions of tropology in Alexander's commentaries, he does not address the obvious paring of those on Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs, or provide any criteria showing why certain of these works can be described as encyclopedias, and others cannot.

Alexander leaves no doubt that the three Wisdom books are to be taken as a series, providing a passage explaining their relationship in terms of stages towards contemplation of the divine: Proverbs inviting a person to disregard for oneself, Ecclesiastes for the world, and the Song of Songs to complete joy.[^primo] He maintains this focus throughout the commentary in a style that directly parallels *Laus uirginis*, providing several more of his 'consolatory meditations'. The relationship between these works is most fully articulated in *Super parabolas*.

[^primo]: *De naturis rerum* 3.1.1, Oxford, Magdalen College, fol. 73v:

    > In primo opere salomonis⸵ inuitatur homo ad contemptum sui. in secundo⸵ ad contemptum mundi. in tercio⸵ ad deliciosam dulcedinem iocunditatis interne contemplationis. Vnde cum idida idest dilectus dictus sit⸵ dictus est et ecclesiastes˷ idest concionator. dictus est et salomon⸵ idest pacificus. Cum enim animus humanus fragilitatem humane conditionis in libro experientie assidue legat⸵ docet hominem⸵ se ipsum paruipendere et contempnere. Incipere namque debet homo a se ipso˷ ut se miserum esse et infinitis uanitatibus obnoxium⸵ addiscat. deinde [73vb] mundana. caduca et transitoria et friula esse sentiat. demum quadam felici mentis extasi⸵ in amorem conditoris sui rapiatur.

### *Meditatio de Magdalena*

The progression of Alexander's meditations becomes increasingly muddy with his later works. His *Meditatio de Magdalena* is also called *Tractatus super admirabili conuersione beatissime Magdalenes* in *Sol meldunensis*. It only refers to *Laus uirginis*,^[Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 140ra: 'De cursu autem petri et iohannis⸵ dilucide licet breuiter nos expediuimus in laudibus uirginis matris.'] and may even have been written before *De naturis rerum*. Alexander's devotion to Mary Magdalene might itself have been inspired through the church near St Frideswide's in Oxford that was administered by the Augustinians. Bestul rightly associated the work with Alexander's Wisdom commentaries, while omitting *Solatium* [@bestul:1999meditation, p. 1], but his imposition of a new paragraph structure on the work obscures its organizational similarities with his other meditations, causing it to appear as a rather amorphous creation. Following the structure of the text provided in the manuscript, *De Magdalena* can be viewed as a commentary on the following texts, each of which is quoted at the beginning of a new paragraph, as in Alexander's other meditations:

1. Song of Songs 1:1, beginning *Osculetur me osculo oris sui.*
2. Luke 7:38–43, *Et osculabatur pedes eius et unguento unguebat.*
3. Luke 10:42, *Porro unum est necessarium. Maria optimam partem elegit quae non auferetur ab ea.*
4. Song of Songs 1:9–10, *Pulchre sunt gene tue sicut turturis.*
5. Song of Songs 2:2, *Sicut lilium inter spinas⸵ sic amica mea inter filias.*
6. Song of Songs 4:1–12, *Quam pulchra es amica mea, quam pulcra.*
7. John 20:1, *Vna autem sabbati, Maria Magdalene uenit mane, cum adhuc tenebre essent, ad monumentum.* (with reference to Mark 16:9 and Matthew 28:9–10; closing with Song of Songs 4:8)

This neatly encapsulates the Gospel passages typically associated with Mary Magdalene in the Middle Ages, using these as a literal interpretation of the Song of Songs: 'Let us listen to the historical words of the evangelist, faithfully expounding the text of Solomon.'^[*De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 140ra: 'Audiamus uerba euangelice historie⸵ textum salomonis fideliter exponentia.'] Mary Magdalene is also associated with several other biblical women such as Rebecca and Sara, all put forward as ideal models for anyone who wishes to 'manfully support a burden and perturbation day and night'[^uiriliter] through meditation and humility, and thereby able to reach the heights of contemplation.[^ignoras]

[^uiriliter]: *De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 136rb:

    > Milites egregii⸵ sunt milites christi. qui uiriliter sustinent pondus et estum dierum et noctium

[^ignoras]: *De Magdalena*, Hereford, Cathedral Library, O.i.2, fol. 136va:

    > Vel cum dicitur. *si ignoras te o pulcherrima inter mulieres*⸵ [Song 1:7] aposiopesis est. Ac si dicatur. Mirum est si anima deliciis contemplationis uacans⸵ felicitatem status sui ignorat. Pulcherrima inter uitas⸵ est uita contemplatiua. Accidit tamen non nunquam⸵ animam que relictis secularibus nugis transiit ad frugem melioris uite. phantasticis paralogizari meditationibus. dum felices illos reputat⸵ qui pompis secularis glorie delectantur.

### *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*

Just as *Laus beatissime uirginis* is an expansion of *Solatium fidelis anime*, Alexander's *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* is even more directly an extension of his *Meditatio de Magdalena*. It runs through the entire 'strong woman' text of Proverbs 31:10–31 three times, dealing in turn with Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, and the Church. The first book includes many borrowings from *De Magdalena*, though it was not conceived as a revision of this work, referring to it separately.^[Jesus College 94, fol. 79ra: 'Beata autem magdalena cuius laudibus iterato deseruire stilus noster gloriatur'.] As with *De Magdalena*, there is no specific evidence that the work was written after *De naturis rerum*. Hunt placed its writing during Alexander's abbacy on the basis that 'he assumes the tone of a superior giving instruction' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 28], but can be disproven through a cross-reference to it early in *Speculum speculationum*, which Hunt affirmed had been begun while Alexander was still a canon [*Speculum speculationum* 1.2.10, London, British Library, Royal 5 F.I, fol. 5va, @thomson:1988alexander, p. 23]. Its reference to *Laus uirginis* refers to it as having been finished, which might imply that this was recent.^[Jesus College 94, fol. 99vb: 'Dulcissima est historialis intelligentie ueritas. quam expositione luculenta declarauimus in opere nostro⸵ quod in laudes gloriose dei genitricis feliciter consummauimus.'] The evidence of a copy of the work with Alexander's autograph corrections, [Oxford, Jesus College, 94] (as discussed in more detail below) as well as the structure of the text suggest that second two books were a later addition.



### *Tractatus super Parabolas Salomonis*

In his commentary on Proverbs, Alexander is finally able to express his full program for meditation.

> The book of Proverbs owes itself to ebbing consideration, by which someone turns towards the state of his condition; Ecclesiastes is answerable to the consideration of the worldly vanities; the book of Canticles indulges divine contemplation. Idida[^idida] shouts that 'the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.' Ecclesiastes preaches, saying, 'Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.' Solomon sighs for the delights of peace, saying, 'Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.' Idida, that is 'you will be beloved by the Lord through humility', which teaches a person to scorn himself and to take prudent fear. Prudence and hope and temperance confer to you the name of a preacher. Prudence, truly investigating the natures of transitory things, understands them to be subject to vanities. Hope, now holding God himself with the hand of desire, declares that everything apart from God is subject to manifold vanity. Temperance, pondering that what is adequate by nature is restrained,<!--?--> knows that the love of temporal things is to be driven out. Holy love and devotion delight to be loved with a kiss and embraces.
>
> In threefold contemplation, therefore, the three works of three-named Solomon are complying: to enter, to depart, to surpass. To enter the chamber of the heart, to enter the dug earth, and to know your situation. The dug earth is the land of free will, which, if it is tilled well by the discipline of a farmer, will produce glad crops of virtues. Therefore, a person should meet himself with the doors of the spirit closed, lest wandering thoughts come near secret tracks, disturbers of inner stilness; he should consult the conscience as to whether, with his path directed through the ways of salvation, he is aimed towards the appropriate goal. Afterwards, to depart from your land with Abraham, that is from the land of free will, and from your family, now untroubled by the disturbances of the mind – to depart, I say, by the steps of contemplation, to perceiving the vanities of things and their advantages. What are the vanities of the world to us, born to greater things?<!--?--> Considering the usefulness of things carries us so much away into the admiration of divine power as its wisdom and kindness. Finally, surpass the worldly machine, and direct the sharpness of the mind so that you may drink from the light of immeasurable glory, and indulge in purified meditations; and with the likenesses of things banished far off, devotion, leading the way, may prepare a journey in pure simplicity of understanding.[^J58va]

## Alexander's commentaries as meditations

The Wisdom books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs were interpreted by Origen as referring to three branches of knowledge: *ethicam*, *physicam*, *epopticen* or *moralem*, *naturalem*, *inspectivam* – roughly translatable as mortal, natural, and contemplative [Origen, trans. Rufinus, *Commentarium in Canticum canticorum* prol.: see @martens:2012origen, p. 79]. Alexander would certainly have been aware of this, as Cirencester is known to have owned a copy of Origen's commentary on the Song of Songs [@mynors:1991registrum, 10.5].


- Alexander wrote on Wisdom books in order to represent all spheres of knowledge


These works probably took their original form as oral addresses, later revised for formal recording in a manuscript. On this point, it is very helpful to compare the sermons on the Song of Songs by Bernard of Clairvaux, whose precise method delivery has long been a matter of contention; it is not altogether clear whether these in fact given as sermons in chapter, or whether they were a strictly literary exercise. Alexander's works contribute to the question by adding an organizational scheme that is evidently designed to allow the book to be used as a reference tool.

To distinguish them from Alexander's other commentaries, these have been categorized as 'monastic', and on a certain level this is an appropriate designation, in terms of following in a ruminative pattern akin to that of, for instance, Rupert of Deutz, or the more contemporary commentary on Lamentations by William of Malmesbury. The meditation on Mary Magdalene and *Solatium fidelis anime* are also included in this category. What is striking about Alexander's commentaries is their personal nature. The *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* appears to be a series of addresses given by Alexander as abbot to his fellow canons; but at the end of this work, he refers to it as *speculum animi mei* – the mirror of his soul. What is the meaning of this, and what function would this have served within his community?

## Meditation and the Augustinians


Alexander's meditations fit into the role

The Rule of St Augustine is maddeningly unspecific, and this is no less the case in its discussion of intellectual pursuits. The *Ordo monasterii* only specifies that adherents should undertake three hours of reading each day at the same time, in addition to listening to readings at meals [*Ordo monasterii* 3, 7, @lawless:1987augustine, 74–75, 76–77]; the *Praeceptum* only underlines these points [*Praeceptum* 2.4, 3.2, 4.9–10, @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85, 96–97]. In the twelfth century, an attempt was made to determine precisely what this meant in the *Colloquium magistri et discipuli in regulam beati Augustini de uita clericorum* (or *Bridlington Dialogue*), based on Richard of St Victor's *De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis* [@webber:1998libraries, p. xxi; from @lawson:1960bridlington, p. 162; Richard's text is edited in @colker:1962richard, p. 219]. It appears that the Augustinian canons themselves had little idea what to make of such strictures. Richard and the *Bridlington Dialogue* tend towards liberality in their interpretations.

The idea of presenting an analytic work as a meditation was hardly new: Anselm of Canterbury is also known for having done this [cf. @cottier:2001anima].

Instead, this work should be understood as one of a series of meditative biblical commentaries he wrote while at Cirencester: along with *De naturis rerum*, there survive a commentary on the *Song of Songs*, also called *Laus beatissime uirginis* [@mcdonough:2004laus]; the *Tractatus super Parabolas Salomonis*, an incomplete commentary covering Proverbs 1:1–3:27; the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, a threefold commentary on Proverbs 31:10–31; and a *Meditatio de Magdalena* [edited in @bestul:1999meditation]. Whenever Alexander himself refers to one of these books, he calls it a 'meditatio'. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how Alexander used this idea from the tradition of monastic biblical commentaries to meet the needs of his community, and to consider its relationship to himself, as when in the conclusion to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* he calls the book 'speculum animi mei' (J, fol. 125ra).

<!--Do we need more engagement with the arguments cited above? -->

> And now those things which pertain to reading have been explained as lucidly and briefly as we know how. But as for the remaining part of learning, namely meditation, I omit saying anything about it in the present work because so great a matter requires a special treatise, and it is more worthy to be altogether silent about a matter of this sort than to say anything about it imperfectly. For it is a thing truly subtle and at the same time delightful, one which both educates beginners and exercises the perfect, one which has not yet been treated in writing and which therefore deserves all the more to be followed up.

bit like @leclercq:1982love [p. 16]:

> In secular usage, *meditari* means, in a general way, to think, to reflect, as does *cogitare* or *considerare*; but, more than these, it often implies an affinity with the practical or even moral order. It implies thinking of a thing with the intent to do it; in other words, to prepare oneself for it, to prefigure it in the mind, to desire it, in a way, to do it in advance briefly, to practice it.

- cites TLL; p. 73 on lectio vs. med.

At the beginning of his commentary on Proverbs, Alexander holds meditation in high regard:

> Human meditation at one moment is turned back on man himself; at another it passes to the other created things; sometimes it is directed to the author of things. While indeed it is turned back to man, contemplation is either directed round those things that look to the dignity of a noble creature, or on those that sink to the fragility of the human condition. When, however, reason, just as if it were sitting in a watchtower, discerns the changes of transitory things, and at times their vanity, it often discovers their usefulness. But while it ventures on that immeasurable light itself, on the contrary devotion rejoices to transfix the sharpness of the mind, for the eye of love runs back gladly to the beloved: sometimes it sweetly sees the humility of taking up humanity, sometimes it reverently regards the height of divine majesty. Therefore reason, entering the inner chamber of the heart and concentrating its thoughts inwards, considers the dignity and fragility of human nature; crossing to the show of the worldly theatre, it recognizes the vanity and usefulness of things; raising itself above itself, it considers the humanity and divinity of the saviour. Thus the dove of divine grace carries the olive-branch of peace to one entering the ark with Noah; thus wisdom, symbolized through Rebecca, runs to meet one going out into the field of the world with Isaac by the grace of meditation; thus mysteries are revealed to one carried into heaven with Paul, which it will not be permitted to disclose to a wise man in the flesh.[^med]

[^med]: *Super parabolas* Proem.1 (Jesus College 94, fol. 57ra):

    > Meditatio humana nunc in ipsum hominem reflectitur. nunc in ceteras transit creaturas⸵ nunc in auctorem rerum. dirigitur. Dum uero in hominem reciprocatur. aut circa ea que spectant ad nobilis creature dignitatem uersatur consideratio⸵ aut in iis que uergunt ad humane conditionis fragilitatem. Cum autem tanquam in specula residens ratio˷ rerum transitoriarum. cernit alterationes⸵ quandoque ipsarum uanitatem˷ non numquam earundem deprehendit utilitatem.

Ingrediens igitur ratio thalamum cordis et se intra se colligens⸵ dignitatem nature humane et fragilitatem considerat. transiens ad spectacula theatri mundialis⸵ rerum agnoscit uanitatem et utilitatem. erigens se supra se⸵ contemplatur humanitatem saluatoris et diuinitatem. Sic ingredienti archam cum Noe⸵ deferet columba diuine gratie⸝ ramum oliue pacis. sic egredienti in agrum mundi istius cum Ysaac gratia meditationis⸵ occurret sapientia per Rebeccam designata. sic rapto in celum cum Paulo⸵ reuelabuntur archana. que non licebit manifestari homini carnaliter sapienti.

## *Meditatio* as a *speculum*

Comment in Rule of St Augustine:

>| These precepts should be read to you once a week,
>| so that you will see yourselves
>| in this little book as in a mirror
>| and not neglect anything through forgetfulness.[^forget]

[^forget]: *Praeceptum* 8.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 102–3:

    >| Ut autem uos in hoc libello
    >| tamquam in speculo possitis inspicere,
    >| ne per obliuionem aliquid neglegatis,
    >| semel in septimana uobis legatur.

This passage is probably what Alexander Neckam has in mind when he refers to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* as *speculum animi mei*, as we will see later.

One of the most instructive texts on Alexander's philosophy of administration is the collection *Corrogationes noui Promethei*. The collection is framed as advice to abbots:

> | What befits the abbot who desires to be loved more
> |     than to be feared? Let love rule from him, and after that fear.[^fear]

[^fear]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei*, lines 1–2, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, lat. 11867, fol. 231va: @cropp:1991critical, p. 163; as emended by @gärtner:2011auftakt:

    > | Quid decet abbatem qui plus optabit amari
    > |     Quam metui? regnet hinc amor, inde metus.

The tone allows the work to be dated to after his election in 1213. It would be rather odd for Alexander to write this if he were not himself an abbot, for what follows gives the impression of being prescriptive rather than humble suggestions for improvement from an underling [other arguments for a late composition are presented in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 60–61; @cropp:1991critical, pp. 47–52].



The first section of the poem presents an abbot who was benevolent but firm, providing instruction that would be both helpful and enjoyable:

> | Therefore let the teacher teach by deed and word;
> |     let honey-sweet words advance from the comb of his mouth.
> | Let the usefulness of his words form a foundation, the teaching of the faithful
> |     delight, but it pleases more by usefulness.[^use]

[^use]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei* 109–112 (BnF lat. 11867, fol. 232ra), @cropp:1991critical, 167–68:

    > | Instruat ergo suos, re, uerbo, doctor; ab oris
    > |     Eius procedant mellea uerba fauo.
    > | Vtilitas uerbis subsit, doctrina fidelis
    > |     Delectat, set plus utilitate iuuat.



Above all, he is to be both learned and virtuous:


> | May the pastor be to his own mirror, book, skill, model of the honest;
> |     Form, measure, guidance, rule, life.[^life]

[^life]: *Corrogationes noui Promethei* 137–38, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, lat. 11867, fol. 232ra, @cropp:1991critical, 169:

    > | Sit pastor speculum, liber, ars, exemplar honesti;
    > |     Forma, modus, regimen, regula, uita suis.

Unfortunately, no letters from Alexander survive that might show in practice how he carried this out, but there are other examples from his time. Alan of Tewkesbury, for instance, applies exegesis to resolve everyday issues and determine how references in the Gospel might effect monastic life. He may have written to Alexander for christological advice [@harris:1982influences, pp. 8–10].

<!--abbots not fond of learning: @harris:1982influences, p. 13n68; @hunt:1936english, p. 26; @leclercq:1982love, p. 241–242 (or 2nd ed?) -->

If Alexander calls his book 'speculum animi mei' (*SMF*, J, fol. 125r) or his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum*, what does it mean for an abbot to be a mirror to his flock?

> Perhaps, book, you will outlive your Alexander. For worms will eat me before grubs gnaw you away. My body is owed to worms; you will be abolished by grubs. You are the mirror of my soul; you are the conveyor of my meditations, the most certain judge of our intentions; you are the faithful messenger of the feelings of my mind, the sweet comfort of sorrow; you are the witness of a truthful conscience. To you, as though to a faithful depositary, I have commended the secrets of my heart. You faithfully return to me the things which I have trusted to your faith; in you I read myself. You will come into the hand of some another devout reader, who will think fit to pour out prayers for me. Then indeed, little book, you will be handed over to the Lord: then you will reward your Alexander with a most pleasing exchange. He will conquer – and I do not begrudge my labour for the prayer of a devout reader – who now puts you in his lap, now moves you to his breast, sometimes places you under his head as a sweet pillow, sometimes caresses you gently with happy hands;  for me he will earnestly entreat Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, God, through endless ages of ages. Amen.[^fortasse]

[^fortasse]: *Super parabolas*, envoi, Oxford, Jesus College 94, fol. 125ra, also quoted in @hunt:1984schools, 17; another translation in @thorndike:1923history, 2:203–4 (who appears to have misread some words):

    > Fortasse tuo liber superstes eris alexandro. Prius enim me
    uermes comedent⸵ quam te tinea corrosura sit. Vermibus debetur corpus meum. te⸵ demolientur tinee. Tu speculum es animi mei. tu meditacionum mearum interpres⸵ propositi nostri

    sancto uiuit et regnat deus per infinita seculorum secula⸵ Amen.

## Alexander's promotion of female figures


## Innovation through meditation



In retrospect, Alexander's work can be seen as one of the last successful attempts to unite all of human knowledge, using the biblical text as a framework. R.W. Southern wrote of the project of what he called 'scholastic humanism' as an attempt to provide a 'complete body of doctrine about both the natural and the supernatural worlds' that would be 'rationally unassailable and doctrinally coherent' – an attempt he called 'entirely misguided' [@southern:1995scholastic, p. 4<!-- check -->]. By the thirteenth century,



The idea of purposely unhurried reading has surfaced again in recent times under banners such as the 'Slow Movement', with several studies suggesting positive psychological benefits [see e.g. @nell:1988psychology]. This question has gained new urgency in the context of reading through electronic devices.
