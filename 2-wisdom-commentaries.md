Title: *Speculum animi mei:* The Wisdom Commentaries
<!--Alexander's work at Cirencester? -->
---

Alexander Neckam's most famous work, *De naturis rerum*, is most commonly described as an 'encyclopedia' [as in @talavera_esteso:1983historia; @fumagalli:1985due; @berlioz:1994recueils; @ribémont:1995natura; @schuler:2000fabrica; @voorbij:2000purpose; @ribémont:2002renaissance; @schuler:2002rives; @tilliette:2005rhétorique; @záhora:2014nature]. This view stems from its first editor's framing of the work, which he stated 'was intended to be a manual of the scientific knowledge of the time' [Wright, introduction to @neckam:1863naturis, p. xiv]. In reality, the published portion of the work is an introduction to a scriptural commentary. Wright's disdain for the project is clear by his explanation of the close to *DNR*, book 2: 'he announces his intention of treating further the subject of human vanities as introductory to his commentary on the book of Ecclesiasticus [*sic* for Ecclesiastes]' [@neckam:1863naturis, p. lxvii].

Understanding *De naturis rerum* as an encyclopedia may help to provide context for some of the works that followed it to which the label has been retroactively applied, but it tells us relatively little about how Alexander conceived of his work. It has also set up false expectations for Alexander's work, meaning that modern audiences are often less than receptive. Rather, it should be understood as one of a series of meditative biblical commentaries he wrote while at Cirencester: along with *De naturis rerum*, the commentary on Ecclesiastes, there survive a commentary on the *Song of Songs*, also called *Laus beatissime uirginis* [@mcdonough:2004laus]; a *Tractatus super Parabolas Salomonis*, an incomplete commentary covering Proverbs 1:1–3:27; the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, a threefold commentary on Proverbs 31:10–31; and a *Meditatio de Magdalena* [edited in @bestul:1999meditation]. Whenever Alexander himself refers to these books, he calls it a 'meditatio'. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how Alexander used this idea from the tradition of monastic biblical commentaries to meet the needs of his community, and to consider its relationship to himself, as when in the conclusion to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* he calls the book 'speculum animi mei' (J, fol. 125ra).

# What is a *meditatio*?

Hunt had very little to say about Alexander's meditatiions, calling them 'the overflow of his personal devotion' <!-- adjust q, taken from Bestul --> [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 106–107]. 

- Hunt's version: not a fan, 'the overflow of [Alexander's] personal devotion' <!-- adjust q, taken from Bestul --> [@hunt:1984schools, pp. 106–107]
- there is a longer tradition of this

# Alexander's definition of 'meditatio'

## In *CProv*

- CProv, J, 57ra

> Meditatio humana nunc in ipsum hominem reflectitur. nunc in ceteras transit creaturas⸵ nunc in auctorem rerum. dirigitur. Dum uero in hominem reciprocatur. aut circa ea que spectant ad nobilis creature dignitatem uersatur consideratio⸵ aut in iis que uergunt ad humane conditionis fragilitatem. Cum autem tanquam in specula residens ratio˷ rerum transitoriarum. cernit alterationes⸵ quandoque ipsarum uanitatem˷ non numquam earundem deprehendit utilitatem. Set dum in illud illud lumen immensum audet. immo gaudet mentis aciem figere deuotio˷ ad dilectum enim libenter recurrit amoris oculus⸵ nunc humanitatis assumpte humilitatem dulciter. nunc diuine maiestatis sublimitatem reuerenter intuetur. Ingrediens igitur ratio thalamum cordis et se intra se colligens⸵ dignitatem nature humane et fragilitatem considerat. transiens ad spectacula theatri mundialis⸵ rerum agnoscit uanitatem et utilitatem. erigens se supra se⸵ contemplatur humanitatem saluatoris et diuinitatem. Sic ingredienti archam cum Noe⸵ deferet columba diuine gratie⸝ ramum oliue pacis. sic egredienti in agrum mundi istius cum Ysaac gratia meditationis⸵ occurret sapientia per Rebeccam designata. sic rapto in celum cum Paulo⸵ reuelabuntur archana. que non licebit manifestari homini carnaliter sapienti.

## Evidence of the *Corrogationes noui Promethei*

One of the most instructive texts on Alexander's philosophy of administration is the collection *Corrogationes noui Promethei* (or *Promothei*). The collection is framed as advice to abbots:

> | What befits the abbot who desires to be loved more
> |     than to be feared? Let love rule from him, and after that fear.

> | Quid decet abbatem qui plus optabit amari
> |     Quam metui? regnet hinc amor, inde metus. [*CNP*, fol. 231va: @cropp:1991critical, lines 1–2; as emended by @gärtner:2011auftakt]

The tone allows the work to be dated to after his election in 1213. It would be rather odd for Alexander to write this if he were not himself an abbot, for what follows gives the impression of being prescriptive rather than humble suggestions for improvement from an underling [other arguments for a late composition are presented in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 60–61; @cropp:1991critical, pp. 47–52].

There has been confusion about the meaning of the title *Corrogationes Promethei* since Alexander's own time [the problem is examined in detail by @cropp:1991critical, pp. 52–71]. A letter survives with a thirteenth-century copy of the work glossing the title as 'congregationes sapientis siue prudentis' ('collections of a wise or prudent man') [Évreux, Bibliothèque municipale, MS L. 72, fol. 1v: reproduced by @omont:1887catalogue, p. 65; @meyer:1896notice, pp. 651–652; @guéry:1917histoire, pp. 393–394]. Meyer felt that the title implied a complaint, preferring to translate the title as 'Travaux d'un homme condamné à l'oisiveté' [@meyer:1896notice, p. 653]. In support of this view, he cites a preface by the younger Peter of Blois, a canon of Chartres, comparing himself to the suffering and banished Prometheus, 'a scolasticis semotus deliciis' [@petrus_blesensis_iunior:1837opusculum, p. 1]. Did Alexander think of himself as exiled to Cirencester, separated from the scholastic delights of Paris and Oxford? Probably not – and even if he did, he was far too optimistic to say it openly. Hunt notes that Prometheus is presented as a teacher when the work is mentioned in *De naturis rerum*; he glosses the title as 'collections of an instructor in the rudiments' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 36]. Wedge, in an attempt to reconcile the three views, amplifies it further: 'collections of a scholar who has only his leisure hours to devote to the study of the Scripture, being at other times weighed down by more worldly duties' [@wedge:1967alexander, p. 77]. <!-- check quotation --> Cropp further points out a Servian interpretation of Prometheus as found in the Third Vatican Mythographer, in which he is presented as a self-sacrificing scholar and instructor [@cropp:1991critical, pp. 69–71]. Perhaps most convincing is the suggestion of the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources* of a reference to *Rhetorica ad Herennium* 4.9, which Alexander could have seen either in the original or in Priscian's quotation of the passage in *Ars grammatica* 3.34 (GL 2:108, lines 10–11). This would make the title a self-deprecating and slightly humourous one – appropriate to Alexander's character.

The first section of the poem presents an abbot who was benevolent but firm, providing instruction that would be both helpful and enjoyable:

> | Instruat ergo suos, re, uerbo, doctor; ab oris
> |     Eius procedant mellea uerba fauo.
> | Vtilitas uerbis subsit, doctrina fidelis
> |     Delectat, set plus utilitate iuuat.

> | Therefore let the teacher teach by deed and word;
> |     let honey-sweet words advance from the comb of his mouth.
> | Let the usefulness of his words form a foundation, the teaching of the faithful
> |     delight, but it pleases more by usefulness. [*CNP*, fol. 232ra: @cropp:1991critical, lines 109–112]

Above all, he is to be both learned and virtuous:

> | Sit pastor speculum, liber, ars, exemplar honesti;
> |     Forma, modus, regimen, regula, uita suis.

> | May the pastor be to his own mirror, book, skill, model of the honest;
> |     Form, measure, guidance, rule, life. [*CNP*, fol. 232ra: @cropp:1991critical, lines 137–38]

If Alexander calls his book 'speculum animi mei' (*SMF*, J, fol. 125r) or his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum*, what does it mean for an abbot to be a mirror to his flock?
