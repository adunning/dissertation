# *Corrogationes noui Promethei*

One of the most instructive texts on Alexander's philosophy of administration is the collection *Corrogationes noui Promethei* (or *Promothei*). The collection is framed as advice to abbots:

> | What befits the abbot who desires to be loved more
> |     than to be feared? Let love rule from him, and after that fear.

> | Quid decet abbatem qui plus optabit amari
> |     Quam metui? Regnet hinc amor, inde metus. [*CNP*, fol. 231va: @cropp:1991critical, lines 1–2; as emended by @gärtner:2011auftakt]

The tone allows the work to be dated to after his election in 1213. It would be rather odd for Alexander to write this if he were not himself an abbot, for what follows gives the impression of being prescriptive rather than humble suggestions for improvement from an underling [other arguments for a late composition are presented in @hunt:1984schools, pp. 60–61; @cropp:1991critical, pp. 47–52].

There has been confusion about the meaning of the title *Corrogationes Promethei* since Alexander's own time [the problem is examined in detail by @cropp:1991critical, pp. 52–71]. A letter survives with a thirteenth-century copy of the work glossing the title as 'congregationes sapientis siue prudentis' ('collections of a wise or prudent man') [Évreux, Bibliothèque municipale, MS L. 72, fol. 1v: reproduced by @omont:1887catalogue, p. 65; @meyer:1896notice, pp. 651–652; @guéry:1917histoire, pp. 393–394]. Meyer felt that the title implied a complaint, preferring to translate the title as 'Travaux d'un homme condamné à l'oisiveté' [@meyer:1896notice, p. 653]. In support of this view, he cites a preface by the younger Peter of Blois, a canon of Chartres, comparing himself to the suffering and banished Prometheus, 'a scolasticis semotus deliciis' [@petrus_blesensis_iunior:1837opusculum, p. 1]. Did Alexander think of himself as exiled to Cirencester, separated from the scholastic delights of Paris and Oxford? Probably not – and even if he did, he was far too optimistic to say it openly. Hunt notes that Prometheus is presented as a teacher when the work is mentioned in *De naturis rerum*; he glosses the title as 'collections of an instructor in the rudiments' [@hunt:1984schools, p. 36]. Wedge, in an attempt to reconcile the three views, amplifies it further: 'collections of a scholar who has only his leisure hours to devote to the study of the Scripture, being at other times weighed down by more worldly duties' [@wedge:1967alexander, p. 77]. <!-- check quotation --> Cropp further points out a Servian interpretation of Prometheus as found in the Third Vatican Mythographer, in which he is presented as a self-sacrificing scholar and instructor [@cropp:1991critical, pp. 69–71]. Perhaps most convincing is the suggestion of the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources* of a reference to *Rhetorica ad Herennium* 4.9, which Alexander could have seen either in the original or in Priscian's quotation of the passage in *Ars grammatica* 3.34 (GL 2:108, lines 10–11). This would make the title a self-deprecating and slightly humourous one – appropriate to Alexander's character.

The first section of the poem presents an abbot who was benevolent but firm, providing instruction that would be both helpful and enjoyable:

> | Instruat ergo suos, re, uerbo, doctor; ab oris
> |     Eius procedant mellea uerba fauo.
> | Vtilitas uerbis subsit, doctrina fidelis
> |     Delectat, set plus utilitate iuuat.

> | Therefore let the teacher teach by deed and word;
> |     let honey-sweet words advance from the comb of his mouth.
> | Let the usefulness of his words form a foundation, the teaching of the faithful
> |     delight, but it pleases more by usefulness. [*CNP*, fol. 232ra: @cropp:1991critical, lines 109–112]

Above all, he is to be both learned and virtuous:

> | Sit pastor speculum, liber, ars, exemplar honesti;
> |     Forma, modus, regimen, regula, uita suis.

> | May the pastor be to his own mirror, book, skill, model of the honest;
> |     Form, measure, guidance, rule, life. [*CNP*, fol. 232ra: @cropp:1991critical, lines 137–38]

If Alexander calls his book 'speculum animi mei' (*SMF*, J, fol. 125r) or his theological treatise *Speculum speculationum*, what does it mean for an abbot to be a mirror to his flock?
