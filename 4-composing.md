title: Personal Correction Practices in the Manuscripts of Alexander Neckam and Samuel Presbiter
author: Andrew Dunning
date: 5 December 2014
abstract: 
    Several manuscripts containing texts by Alexander Neckam and Samuel Presbiter can  be shown to contain corrections by their authors. In both cases, the authorial presence is determined through a combination of original modifications (as opposed to those that might have been made from an exemplar); interaction between the author and the scribe; and multiple changes to minute details such as punctuation and spelling.

One of the most exciting aspects of studying medieval texts as opposed to those from the classical period is the possibility of reading the same volume that author themselves worked on. Medieval autographs are constantly being discovered; we famously have writings in the hand of Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great [the classic article on medieval autographs is @lehmann:1920autographe; updated, -@lehmann:1941autographe]. Less studied, but probably even more common, is the situation of a book not copied but corrected by its author. This can be difficult to detect, and the identification is often debatable. Today, I will present two cases from the dawn of thirteenth-century England: those of Alexander Neckam, abbot of the Augustinian abbey of Cirencester; and Samuel Presbiter, a student of William de Montibus at Lincoln who might have been somehow associated with the Benedictine abbey of Bury St Edmunds later in life.

There are a number of authors from twelfth- and thirteenth-century England whose works have been found in autograph: some of the most interesting examples include William of Malmesbury [@thomson:2003william], Matthew Paris [@vaughan:1953handwriting; @vaughan:1958matthew], and Ranulph Higden [@galbraith:1959autograph]. The flexible nature of historical writing lends itself particularly well to discovering authorial modifications (helped along by sustained scholarly interest in the genre). Universal to these are the substantive revisions one would immediately associate with revised manuscripts: typically not only consisting of revisions but of erasure and modification of existing material. Matthew Paris, for instance, adds an anecdote explaining Alexander Neckam's unusual name to the margin of his *Gesta abbatum* that he probably discovered after the passage was originally composed, and appropriately added it to the correct point in the chronology. Studies have also consistently noted, however, the presence of tinkering with more detailed aspects of the work: changes to paragraph structure, chapter divisions (Ranulph Higden being an especially amusing example of this, who contrives new openings for a large number of chapters so that their first letters will spell his name), spelling, and especially punctuation. These details often do not come out in editions of these works, because editors usually modernize all punctuation and always omit it from their apparatus. It is precisely through these details, I argue, that one can detect an author's involvement even without sweeping revisions.

# Alexander Neckam

Alexander Neckam (1157–1217) does not fit neatly into any of the categories typically assigned to authors of the past – it would be both too much and too little to say that he was a theologian, philosopher, or poet, though he participated in all these activities. The only label that has stuck has been that of ‘polymath’. It is better to think of him on historical terms, as a teacher (among the first known in Oxford), Augustinian canon, and abbot who sought to sought to write books that would meet the needs of his audiences. He was plainly interested in the production of books, for he makes a number of interesting remarks about their production in his works *De nominibus utensilium* and *Sacerdos ad altare* [discussed in @gumbert:2011tacketed; @gasparri:2007terminologie; @vezin:2005reconstitution; @gullick:1996from]. To judge from the surviving volumes, Cirencester had a particularly lively tradition of book production from the mid-twelfth century up to the thirteenth: their volumes are finely executed, often with brilliantly decorated initials, and unusually their scribes had a tradition of signing their books. Cirencester is known to have had a nearly complete set of Alexander's works – several of which have not survived from any other libraries, though most are known from medieval catalogues to have existed elsewhere [see @mynors:1991registrum, pp. 288–89 (no. 104); Leland's list in @webber:1998libraries, pp. 27–28; @ker:1964medieval, pp. 51–52; @ker:1987medieval, p. 14]. It is only to be expected that, if there are surviving contemporary copies of a work from an author's institution, he might have made at least some annotations in them.

Alexander's hand was first identified by @hunt:1984schools [pp. 30–31], who appears to have examined nearly all the manuscripts containing Alexander’s works, but did not have the time to do more than make a list of identifications. He guessed that part of Oxford, Jesus College 94 preserves the author’s handwriting, but he did not explain his rationale for this in much detail. In this commentary, we find a series of notes that certainly appear to be additions; it is also worth noting that the manuscript is a rather rough-looking copy, which seems to be common to other extensively annotated working copies. Before assuming they are from the author, however, it is necessary to determine that they are not either mere omissions or passages copied from another manuscript representing a revised version of the work. If one compares the manuscript to other surviving copies of the commentary, one finds in fact that none of them contain the additions – except one, now London, British Library, Royal MS 2.C.XI. If one compares the texts closely, however, the only logical conclusion is to say that could not have been copied from the Royal manuscript into Jesus College 94, and that the reverse is likely true. The Royal manuscript contains all the additions, but they are sometimes integrated in a slightly different way from that indicated in the annotated copy, and often a few words have been added to make the transitions smoother [to be fair, @hunt:1936alexander, pp. 266–271, includes an extract from the commentary to Psalm 5, indicating that he was probably aware of this]. Besides tidying various things up, the additions are largely adding to the authorities cited, noting for example relevant examples from the *Glosa*. It is not altogether clear what period the manuscript is from: it certainly does not have the appearance of other books produced at Cirencester. On the other hand, the lack of the additions in most of the manuscripts shows that the text had circulated before the revisions were made, so they are probably to be tied to intellectual development at Cirencester. The manuscript is incomplete, and was combined with two other booklets to form a volume of Alexander's works. The Cirencester community did not apparently think it particularly usable, for they later acquired an enormous deluxe copy, complete with illustrations in gold leaf – lacking, however, the revisions.

@gullick:1990twelfth [pp. 21–23] discovered a second manuscript containing the same hand as that identified by Hunt: here, Alexander can be found intelligently correcting and annotating a copy of the letters of Thomas Becket (London, British Library, Cotton MS Claudius B.ii). Gullick notes Alexander's habit of arranging marginal notes in the form of a reversed triangle – a form repeated even in the marginal notes of copies of Alexander's works. Thomas Wright observed in his edition of *De naturis rerum* that there was a pattern of consistent marginal titles in his manuscripts, suggesting that they were part of the original [introduction to @wright:1863naturis, p. lxxvii]. There are a number of other books that have corrections looking like Alexander's hand, but it seems that there was at least one other person at Cirencester who wrote similarly.

Alexander can be more certainly be found revising the other parts of Jesus College 94, which were once separate manuscripts: an unfinished commentary on Proverbs, and the *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, a meditation on the last chapter of Proverbs. These are both much cleaner copies than the Psalms commentary, and it seems Alexander wished to keep them that way: most of his additions have been written faintly somewhere in the margin (often at the base of the page), and later another scribe has integrated them more formally into the text. Where an addition is too long to be inserted directly, the addition is generally recopied and has a decorative border applied to it. Long additions to these texts are fairly scarce, but again the purpose of many of them seems to be to integrate additional quotations, as for example when a line from Job 29:18 is added to an already long collection of Old Testament references in the proem to Proverbs (fol. 57va). There are also many corrections of spelling that do not change the meaning of the text.

There are no other copies of the commentary on Proverbs to which the text can be compared; in the case of *Super Mulierem fortem*, however, one finds the interesting phenomenon that the other copy of the text (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 528) does not include the corrections, and where one can make out the pre-corrected reading in the Jesus College manuscript, it usually matches that of the Bodley text. Evidently, then, this is a case of later revision to the text rather than an exemplar being corrected before the text is copied for distribution elsewhere. In this text, the most significant additions are marginal headings added to the latter parts of the work, imitating the style found in Alexander's larger commentaries. One also finds, again, seemingly unnecessary changes to spelling, and it is also possible to perceive changes to punctuation and paragraph structure. Headings are also a primary focus of his attention in correcting the copy of *De naturis rerum* (a hybrid discussion of natural phenomena and commentary on Ecclesiastes) now Oxford, Magdalen College, MS 139. From this revision stems two different textual traditions: one including numbered chapters with headings in the later books, and one lacking these.

Compare another manuscript which it is tempting to think might have been corrected by Alexander: London, British Library, Royal MS 7.F.I. This is the sole witness to *Speculum speculationum*, a theological *summa* following the structure of Peter Lombard's *Sentences*. Here, like the manuscripts of the commentary on Proverbs, *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem*, and *De naturis rerum*, we have a number of marginal corrections in a hand similar to that identified as Alexander's, but which seems to differ somewhat [judged in @neckam:1988speculum, p. xx]. Almost all the examples appear to be corrections from an exemplar, since they can be seen to be cases of *homoeoteleuton*.

## The Neckam Florilegium, 'Sol meldunensis'

As a parting example of autographs connected to Alexander Neckam, it is also worth mentioning the florilegium of his works in Cambridge, University Library, Gg.6.42, which has the incipit 'Sol meldunensis'. It seems to have been produced at Cirencester. It is addressed to 'Gaufridus' (fol. 71v), abbot of the nearby abbey of Malmesbury, which allows the book to be dated to 1246–60; the author identifies himself as 'Galfridus' (fol. 3r) [the author is not otherwise known, though a 'magister Galfridus de Stanrewik' is mentioned as owing rent to the house in 1240: @ross:1964cartulary, no. 614]. The book cleverly strings together passages from nearly all Alexander's works (including some that do not otherwise survive) to form new 'sermons', as it presents them, adding connecting phrases to blend the excerpts together, though the resulting works are so long that they can hardly have been used as such.

@mcdonough:2005cambridge judges that the book was probably a near copy to the original; I would go so far as to say that it *is* the original. There are several long passages added to the text after the fact, done in a way that indicates addition rather than correction. Perhaps most tellingly, at one point the scribe is copying out the following passage from Neckam's commentary on Proverbs:

> Melius est sedere in angulo domatis quam in domo communi cum uxore litigiosa. Set hec deo annuente exponetur … (fol. 173v)

If we look at the copy of the commentary in Oxford, Jesus College, MS 94, the next word should have been 'inferius', but this is omitted. The compiler seems to have been happily reading along, and suddenly realized that this will not be 'explained below' in this book, because he is planning to end the excerpt at the end of the next sentence. He skips over 'inferius' partially erases 'set hec deo annuente exponetur' (and further underlines it in red to indicate that it is to be ignored), and the scribe moves on.

I have not yet been able to conclude decisively whether or not this work is a direct autograph of Galfridus. While almost the entire book is in the same hand, there is two passages added in other hands (fols. 13v and 166r), the latter of which can be seen to be contemporary with the manuscript by the fact that it is integrated into its decorative scheme.  Perhaps one of these is an addition in the hand of the compiler, with the rest is dictated by him. In yet another hand is a glossed copy of a work written by another Galfridus, presented as a letter of Geoffrey of Malmesbury to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, which is somewhat less professionally executed and added onto the manuscript. (Having another Geoffrey and Alexander together probably seemed too good a coincidence to omit.) Clearly, in any case, Galfridus was not working alone: it is sometimes easier to determine authorial involvement than to pinpoint the author's precise role.

# Samuel Presbiter

Samuel Presbiter is an almost completely unknown author; his name only survives at the end of two manuscripts from the library of Bury St Edmunds (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 860 and Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 115). Given that both of the manuscripts containing Samuel's works are from Bury St Edmunds, the author might conceivably have been associated with the abbey. It seems likely that Samuel was involved in the production of the surviving books containing his writings, with a correcting hand found in both manuscripts that reflects an intimate knowledge of the texts and willingness to make changes that would point to the presence of someone more significant than a zealous pedant in possession of the exemplar.

Similarly in some ways to the Galfridus's florilegium, though with more creativity, Samuel openly compiles passages from other sources in new ways (most of his works include the word 'collecta' in their title) and versifies them, an art he seems to have learned from master William de Montibus, under whom he studied at Lincoln [see @goering:1992william]. It is tempting to dismiss Samuel as a mere excerpter [@russell:1936dictionary, p. 147 (s.v. ‘Samuel Presbyter’)], or as Brian Twyne thought, little more than a devotee of William de Montibus [‘Qui Gulielmi de Monte celeberrimi suo tempore Oxoniae theol. professoris auditor diligens et admirator extitit.’ Quoted in @tanner:1748bibliotheca, p. 651]. Samuel himself provides some idea of his motives behind his work. The first folios of both <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms</span> Bodley 860 and Pembroke College, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms</span> 115 contain a text written as a *distinctio* in red ink, forming hexameter lines that can be read in four different ways:

> | Mens conseruetur per opus ne stulta uagetur.
> | Sic studiis detur ut que prosint operetur.
> | Mens conseruetur ut que prosint operetur.
> | Sic studiis detur per opus ne stulta uagetur.

<!-- > | The mind is maintained through work lest it roam in stupidity.
> | Thus it is given to study so that it may labour on useful things.
> | The mind is maintained in order that it may labour on useful things.
> | Thus it is given to study through work lest it roam in stupidity.-->

In the same format, both manuscripts have the following at the bottom of the last page of text:^[Fol. 206v in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms</span> Bodley 860; fol. 77r <!-- Really? Not verso? --> of Pembroke College, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms</span> 115.]

> | Hec qui collegit eterna pace quiescat.
> | Hec quicumque legit oret simul ut requiescat.
> | Hec quicumque legit eterna pace quiescat.
> | Hec qui collegit oret simul ut requiescat.

<!-- > | May he who collected these things sleep in eternal peace.
> | May whoever reads these things pray likewise that he may rest.
> | May whoever reads these things sleep in eternal peace.
> | May he who collected these things pray likewise that he may rest. -->

Finally, the first page of *Collecta super psalmos* (fol. 9r) includes these lines at the top of the page, again written in red ink:

> | Hec qui collegi studiose pleraque legi.
> | Quedam que legi credite digna legi.
> | Hec qui collegi credite digna legi.
> | Quedam que legi studiose pleraque legi.

<!-- > | These things which I have collected, I have read studiously and widely.
> | Whatever I have read, I have read trustingly as worthy things.
> | These things which I have collected, I have read trustingly as worthy things.
> | Whatever I have read, I have read studiously and widely. -->

These passages are not only personal statements, but help to show the unity of the two volumes. In both manuscripts, the only attribution to Samuel comes at the end, but it can presumably be taken to refer to the entire contents, given their consistent style. The Oxford manuscript, however, is a composite of originally separate books, meaning that the explicit of this manuscript can only strictly be taken to refer to the last two works in the volume, *Collecta ex diuersis auditis* and *Collecta ad habendam memoriam*, though there there is no real question of the association of the other two works with Samuel, helped along by the verses found at the beginning of the book.

It seems likely that Samuel was involved in the production of the books containing his writings, with a correcting hand found in both manuscripts that reflects an intimate knowledge of the texts and willingness to make changes that would point to someone more than a zealous pedant in possession of the exemplar. Both books are largely in the same hand, using a smaller script for prose passages and glosses (typically about 4 mm tall), and a slightly taller and finer hand for verses (with letters about 6 mm tall). A different hand, with thin strokes and generally in a lighter shade of ink, has corrected both manuscripts. The commentaries in *Collecta ex diuersis auditis* and the works in the Pembroke College manuscript were copied along with the rest of the text, and the page is ruled in such a way to accommodate prose as well as verse. On the other hand, the Psalm 1 paraphrase and *Collecta ad habendam memoriam,* the first and last works found in MS Bodley 860, were originally arranged on the page to include verse only without a commentary. The comments on these works are added in a rather haphazard way wherever they can be made to fit on the page, but they are written in a neat fashion, and are formal explanations rather than off-hand remarks from a reader [@bruun:2009samuel, p. 168]. They have been added over an extended period of time, to judge from the many shades of ink and variations in the hand, among which the corrector can sometimes be found. If this material had been available when the book was first written, and especially if the book had been copied from a complete exemplar, one would assume that the scribe would have arranged them in the same formal fashion as used elsewhere.

Given that both manuscripts containing Samuel’s works are at least partially in the same hand, one might ask whether the author himself might have written them; this seems unlikely. To focus on one work, *Collecta ex diuersis auditis*, it can be found that the scribe was not always able to read the exemplar, but was concerned to write precisely what he saw. In particular, the scribe often writes ‘c’ or ‘t’ for ‘m’ and ‘n’ (giving us, for example, ‘acumaretur’ for ‘animaretur’, ‘iutibra’ for ‘umbra’, ‘consideratis’ for ‘considerans’, ‘sitium’ for ‘sinum’) and for ‘r’ (‘tectum’ for ‘rectum’, ‘iurate’ for ‘iurare’, ‘considerate’ for ‘considerare’, ‘carhalogus’ for ‘cathalogus’, ‘fiete’ for ‘fieri’; in reverse, ‘ira’ for ‘ita’). There are also some lacunae that seem to indicate that the scribe could not read the exemplar, later filled in by the corrector.

This corrector is intimately familiar with the text, and seems to have gone through it methodically after it was copied; he leaves a faint note in the lower corner of MS Bodley 860, fol. 103r that reads ‘usque hunc in parte’. Some of the corrections could have been made by anyone with an exemplar, but some of them seem to be original, in particular the points in the text where the corrector adds a variant word for understanding the verse (e.g. *uel legit* for *posuit*). This is frequently found in Samuel's verses. In most cases, they note a word that should be understood in place of the one glossed, but they are usually unmetrical alternatives, thus why the original verse is not changed (which the corrector does not hesitate to do). There are also cases in which it seems likely that the corrector is revising the work rather than making a correction from an exemplar, though many of these revisions are relatively slight. The corrector also carefully revises the punctuation, adding particularly *puncti eleuati* to the verses. All of these are fairly minor points: but to have the same hand adding commentary, changing punctuation, improving spelling, and in general being a both careful and confident corrector is, I believe, enough to say that this is the work of the text's author.

# Conclusion

The manuscripts discussed today of Alexander Neckam and Samuel Presbiter are not autographs in the usual sense, but contain revisions that can be demonstrated to represent a later form of a text; original modifications as opposed to those that might have been made from the exemplar; and multiple changes to minute details such as punctuation and spelling. While some of these features could be the work of readers, the ability to link them to more substantive revisions seems sufficient to confirm an authorial presence. These trends should cause us to think about the way we edit medieval books. If authors thought it worth their time to correct their punctuation, surely it is worth our time to track this and present these details to modern readers. With the ability to present an edition of a text in a digital format, this can be done easily without sacrificing readability. It is not always clear *why* these particular books were produced. They are not presentation copies, nor do they always seem to have served as exemplars; where copies are known to have been made at all, the corrections are often not present in other manuscripts. They seem to have been personal copies that existed primarily for the pleasure of a local community, as a benefit of having a resident author.
