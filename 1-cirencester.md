title: "The unity of Alexander's career and his literary works"
---

When Alexander Neckam became the abbot of St Mary’s abbey in Cirencester in 1213, a position he held until his death in 1217 [@knowles:2001heads, pp. 1:159–60, with corrections on 1:278], he became the head of an organization that was very much tied up with the cares of the world; a powerful figure who was also lord of the manor, by royal prerogative [on the early relationship between the abbots and the townspeople, see @rollison:2011commune, ch. 1; @fuller:1884cirencester]. He was the sixth to hold this position since the reconstitution of the abbey by Henry I in 1117 [on the abbey's early history, see @wilkinson:1998cirencester; @evans:1993cirencester]. With perhaps forty canons resident, Cirencester was one of the largest Augustinian foundations in England [@knowles:1948religious, p. 2:259]. Alexander was an important administrator, and there is an essential unity between Alexander Neckam's many literary works and his career as a teacher, Augustinian canon, and abbot.

# Augustinians and their books

What did it mean to have an abbot of an Augustinian abbey who also had an active literary career? Among the English Augustinians in the early thirteenth century, there are few examples:

The Rule of St Augustine is maddeningly unspecific, and this is no less the case in its discussion of intellectual persuits. There are only two passages relating to books or reading in the *Ordo Monasterii* after an early discussion of the lessons for the offices:

>| Operentur a mane usque ad sextam,
>| et a sexta usque ad nonam uacent lectioni,
>| et ad nonam reddant codice.

>| Let them work from early morning till noon
>| and take leisure for reading from noon till three,
>| and at three o'clock return the books. [*Ordo Monasterii* 3, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 74–75]

---

>| Sedentes ad mensam taceant, audientes lectionem.

>| When seated at table,
>| they are to be silent and listen to the reading. [*Ordo Monasterii* 7, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 76–77]

The *Praeceptum* is a little more specific, but still has little to say:

>| Et nolite cantare, nisi quod legitis esse cantandum;
>| quod autem non it a scriptum est ut cantetur, non cantetur.

>| Keep to the prescribed text when you sing;
>| avoid texts which are not suited for singing. [*Praeceptum* 2.4, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85]

---

>| Cum acceditis ad mensam, donec inde surgatis,
>| quod uobis secundum consuetudinem legitur,
>| sine tumultu et contentionibus audite.

>| Listen to the customary reading
>| from the beginning to the end of the meal
>| without commotion or arguments. [*Praeceptum* 3.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 84–85]

---

>| Siue autem qui cellario, siue qui uestibus,
>| siue qui codicibus praeponuntur,
>| sine murmure seruiant fratribus suis.
>| Codices certa hora singulis diebus petantur;
>| extra horam qui petierit, non accipiat.

>| Those responsible for food, clothing, or books
>| are to serve their brothers without grumbling.
>| Books are to be requested at a definite hour each day;
>| requests made at other times will be denied. [*Praeceptum* 4.9–10, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 96–97]

Webber and Watson point out an attempt to determine precisely what this means in the *Colloquium magistri et discipuli in regulam beati Augustini de uita clericorum* (or *Bridlington Dialogue*), based on Richard of St Victor's *De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis* [@webber:1998libraries, p. xxi; from @lawson:1960bridlington, p. 162; Richard's text is edited in @colker:1962richard, p. 219]. It appears that the Augustinian canons themselves had little idea what to make of such strictures. Richard and the *Bridlington Dialogue* tend towards liberality in their interpretations.



But it also has this comment:

>| Ut autem uos in hoc libello
>| tamquam in speculo possitis inspicere,
>| ne per obliuionem aliquid neglegatis,
>| semel in septimana uobis legatur.

>| These precepts should be read to you once a week,
>| so that you will see yourselves
>| in this little book as in a mirror
>| and not neglect anything through forgetfulness. [*Praeceptum* 8.2, translated by @lawless:1987augustine, 102–3]

This passage is probably what Alexander Neckam has in mind when he refers to his *Tractatus super Mulierem fortem* as *speculum animi mei*, as we will see later.

Why were books important to such an order?


- who were the Augustinians?
+ stuff about pastoral care: did this matter?

- why are books important?

- what does Watson/Webber say about books?
- what did augustinians read?
- does the 'pastoral care' thing matter?

- what do rules say about daily life and about provision for books?

- importance of teaching?


- what were the expectations of a typical canon?

- what intellectual attitudes to they show, esp. to scholasticism? (how does this compare to other orders? start with R.W.S.)

- how does A compare?

Alexander, as a teacher, would have fit in very well with such a group

# Alexander's education

- so how does this mesh with what A. would have learned under William de M?

- note his specific praise of M. in *LSD*



# Alexander at Oxford and Robert of Cricklade's influence

Past scholars have assumed that Alexander became an Augustinian at Cirencester, but the evidence for this is slim. This is based purely on a letter of Peter of Blois to 'Master Alexander of St Albans' congratulating him taking up monastic vows, having given up the 'honorem magisterii' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)]. Alexander had evidently left a teaching career to become a canon. It is often asserted that the letter is from 1197 [@southern:1984schools, p. 25; @hunt:1964oxford, p. 000], as it occurs in what has been identified as a later recension of the letter collections that Peter of Blois began to circulate around 1184, thought to have been compiled between 1198 and 1205 [@cotts:2009clerical, pp. 281-284 summarizes the debate]; but this only circumscribes the latest possible date of its composition. Peter's phrase 'litteratura siquidem uestra, et famae commendabilioris celeberrimus odor' [@giles:1847petri, p. 2:22 (no. 137)] is of no help, as Alexander is thought to have begun writing long before his time at Oxford [@hunt:1984schools, p. 000]. Alexander had resolved to join an order at an early age, recording that he had made a pact with a friend to join a monastic order rose while he was still a student [@hunt:1984schools, p. 000], and there would be no reason to delay this decision until he was at the age of forty. It is equally possible, therefore, that the letter may indicate a departure from his position as the schoolmaster at St Albans, and joining of the Augustinians at Oxford, rather than his move to Cirencester.

<!-- check [@revell:1993later; @taliadoros:2011communities; @wahlgren:1993letter] -->

Alexander must have also had a relationship with the priory of St Frideswide's in Oxford. He preached a sermon there exhorting the people to restore the church after the roof collapsed in a fire of 1190 [Hoch? Cropp? Hunt], and a few other sermons. Alexander does not appear in the abbey cartulary, <!-- check: does Robert? --> making it difficult to prove that he had formally entered the priory.

> Vita claustralium media est inter uitam scolarium et uitam triumphantium. Dormi igitur *inter medios cleros* [Ps. 67:14], hos est in medio sortium. Est enim quedam sors gratie honestas uite scolarium, sors ultima est delitiosa iocunditas uite triumphantium, media tranquillitas claustralium. [*Commentary on the Song of Songs* 2.16 (M, fol. 79rb): cited by @hunt:1984schools, p. 9n43]

- what do we know about St Frideswide's, A's home?

- Robert de: what did he write?

- note his real dates, which are not what most people think (edition)

> Studiosis et precipue claustralibus et scolasticis Rodbertus Crikeladensis prior Oxinefordie non superbe sapere, sed tramitem discipline humiliter percurrere. Plinii Secundi libros de Naturali Historia XXXVII in IX coartare uolumina conatus sum ad communem omnium ea legere uolentium utilitatem, hac usus breuitate, ut uobis satisfaciam et fastidiosis causam ocitandi tolla. placuit enim memorabiliora et utiliora conscibere, superfluis uero et nostro tempori non necessariis supersedere. quid enim prodest singularum urbium aut uiculorum siue etiam locorum nomina percurrere, cum non uiculorum siue etiam locorum nomina percurrere, cum non liceat inde tributa exigere? [@näf:2002roberti, pp. 2–3]


The abbess Frithuswith or St Frideswide, the patron of the abbey in Oxford (now Christ Church) where Alexander came into maturity, was traditionally depicted as a learned figure. In the abbey seal from *c.* 1190 [as @blair:2004frithuswith; 'mid to late 1180s' according to @heslop:1988late, pp. 271–272], she holds a set of wax tablets<!--Goering suggests--> or an open book in her left hand, and a fleur-de-lis in her right [reproduced from four Oxford charters in @wigram:1895_1896cartulary, p. 1:ii; composite drawing from London, BL Seal Cast LXX.79 in @heslop:1988late, p. 272]. This connects her equally with the typical female personifications of the liberal arts and the church, as much as with ecclesiastical administration [@heslop:1988late, p. 271–272]. Frideswide is also shown as a precocious child in two twelfth-century lives [both passages are translated in @blair:1987saint, pp. 74-75]. In 'Life A', from *c.* 1100–30, she learns the Psalter in six months [Life A §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 96: seven months in Oxford, Balliol College, 228; @blair:2004frithuswith, p. 32]; 'Life B', an expanded version dated to *c.* 1140–70 and attributed to Robert of de, Alexander's mentor as the prior of St Frideswide's, reduces this to five months and emphasizes the extent of the improvement this wrought on her character, reflecting the highest medieval ideals for learning [Life B §3: @blair:1987saint, p. 103; on the attribution to Robert, see @blair:1987saint, p. 80].

- did R send A to Cirencester? if so, why?



# Alexander as a canon at Cirencester



- what would A have thought when he arrived at Cirencester

- which brings us to the next chapter, on what he feels the need to supply

The fall fair for which Cirencester later earned renown was also initiated during Alexander's time [@ross:1964cartulary, <!-- page --> no. 43; @leland:itinerary, p. 1:129 (part II, fol. 24: cf. 3:101–102, part VI, fol. 65), refers to a Monday market; quoted in @willis:1718history, p. 1:61].

'Love-days': Alexander defending Gloucester [@richardson:1941select, p. clxxix–clxxxi; cited in @hunt:1984schools, p. 13; translated in @rothwell:1996english, p. 863]




- summarize argument: Augustinians liked books, there are evident reasons why A would be attracted to them, and Cirencester was a good fit
- the ethos of the order is an influence, and he is bringing stuff from scholasticism to Cirencester



# Surviving books from Cirencester

- so why Cirencester?

A market town where there was no end of work for them.



It is perhaps notable that there are very few glossed biblical texts among these remnants. This was a major feature, for instance, of the library at Oseney Abbey, which is otherwise a similarly conservative collection to that of Cirencester (it owned a volume of Alexander Neckam, but this was an addition of the fifteenth century).

- what did they have in C?

# Scribes at Cirencester and their ‘house style’



TODO: does it even make sense to include this section here?

- St Mary’s in Frankenal: A Cirencester connection? how does the analysis of this place work?

- St Bart's Smithfield? write BL lady Boyle lecture about this

- St Fridewide's? write Henry Mayer-Hartig as introduced by Fr O'Donavan

To judge from surviving volumes, Cirencester had a rich tradition of making books, and seems to have developed something of a house style, with a peculiarly beautiful method of creating decorated initials. Almost all the books at Cirencester from before Alexander’s time, however, were copies of patristic works, as were common at Augustinian houses. One can also get some idea of the books Alexander had access to through citations in his writings, though it is not altogether clear whether he consulted them at Cirencester or elsewhere.

Alexander clearly benefited from the patristic reading available to him, but clearly wanted something more current and direct. During his time at Paris, Alexander was inspired by the work of authors such as his teacher William de Montibus to bring the latest in scholastic theology to bear on practical pastoral matters. When he came to Cirencester, he was probably shocked to find that he had no such tools to accomplish what he saw as his work there. Alexander’s writings, however, would have represented something quite new to the canons: works that they could use in everyday life.

One of the most remarkable features of the earlier books from Cirencester is their very detailed colophons. @webber:1998libraries have suggested that these were included as a reminder to pray for the souls of those who made the books and their benefactors [pp. xxv, 26].
