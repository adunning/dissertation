# The Writing and Dissemination of Alexander Neckam's Works at Cirencester: A Historical and Codicological Study

# Abstract

The works of Alexander Neckam (Nequam, Neckham, Necham) are typically approached as products directed towards separate scholastic and monastic audiences, as is reflected in the title of R.W. Hunt’s study *The Schools and the Cloister*. This thesis argues that Alexander’s later works were all written for the Augustinian community at Cirencester, and that as canon and later abbot he composed works that would fill a lack of practical books that served as tools for the order’s work in its community. The evidence for this is derived primarily from an analysis of the manuscripts containing Alexander’s works, a number of which appear to be derived directly from copies made at Cirencester.
